''\nWhile Ryan is the chief author of the GOP 's budget proposal , he does not work alone and there are varying perspectives .

''\nWhile Ryan would not elaborate on any details from his new budget ahead of Tuesday 's release , there are reports he could raise the threshold at which people are protected from changes to the Medicare eligibility age .\nOn the House floor , Republicans hold a 232-200 majority , plus there are three vacant seats .

Small businesses , who get government relief money are expected to rehire workers , are unsure when the business will reopen and how it will operate . ( AP Photo/Charles Krupa )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — Some small businesses that obtained a highly-coveted government loan say they won ’ t be able to use it to bring all their laid-off workers back , even though that is what the program was designed to do .\nThe Paycheck Protection Program promises a business owner loan forgiveness if they retain or rehire all the workers they had in late February . But owners say the equation isn ’ t so simple , in part because of current economic conditions and partly due to the terms of the loans .\nAs a result , the lending may not reduce unemployment as much as the Trump administration and Congress hope .\nThe government ’ s $ 2 trillion relief package included $ 349 billion for the small business loan program , which was besieged with applications and ran out of money Thursday . Congress and the White House reached a deal Tuesday that would provide another $ 310 billion .\nTo get the loans forgiven , companies need to spend 75 % on payroll within eight weeks of receiving the money . The other 25 % can be spent on rent , utilities , and mortgage payments . Otherwise , the loan has generous terms : Only a 1 % interest rate and six months before any principal is due .\nMany of the small companies that were able to obtain a loan are having second thoughts about rehiring all their workers and a few plan to return the money . Others will use what they can on rent and utilities , and will use some to rehire a portion of their laid-off staff . But most are unsure they will be able to reopen eight weeks from now . They see little point in rehiring all their workers , paying them to do little or nothing , and then potentially laying them off again if business remains weak two months from now .\n“ You ’ re turning the business into a pass through for the federal government , ” said Joe Walsh , who owns Clean Green Maine , a cleaning service in Portland , Maine with 35 employees . “ You ’ re doing very little to actually help the business . ”\nIt ’ s unclear how much the small business lending program can hold back the surge in joblessness — a record 22 million people sought unemployment aid in the past month . Most economists forecast the unemployment rate will reach between 15 % and 20 % when the monthly jobs report is released in early May .\nMore money is clearly needed : Roughly 1.6 million small companies were able to obtain loans , the Small Business Administration said , out of at least 6 million that were likely eligible , according to Census data . Bank of America economists estimate that another $ 650 billion would be necessary to meet demand .\nAlso , the generous unemployment aid that was also included in the government ’ s relief package has made it more difficult to rehire . Many workers are making more with unemployment checks , which now include a $ 600 weekly benefit from the federal government .\nWalsh , who received a $ 280,000 loan from the SBA , said that he is reluctant to push his employees to return to work because , under unemployment benefit rules , they could lose their weekly checks if they turn down potential jobs .\n“ That ’ s just putting me as the employer in a really difficult position , ” Walsh said . He pays at least $ 17 an hour , with benefits , but his former employees are getting the equivalent of roughly $ 25 an hour from unemployment .\nRight now , Walsh ’ s business is closed due to lack of demand for cleaning services . He hopes to reopen soon and bring back some workers , retrain them on new sanitizing processes , and earn a bit of revenue . Still , he doubts his business will be anywhere close to what it was anytime soon , which means his workforce won ’ t be either .\n“ There ’ s no way that I ’ m getting to 100 % employment by the end of 8 weeks , ” he said .\nThe National Federation for Independent Business , a small business advocacy group , is pushing the government to make it easier for loans to be forgiven .\nThe group wants the SBA to eliminate the requirement that 75 % be spent on payroll , or at least reduce it to 50 % . It also wants the rehiring window extended beyond eight weeks and is pushing for a “ good faith ” provision that would credit companies for trying to rehire workers who prefer unemployment aid instead .\nThe NFIB also asked that half the next round of funding be reserved for businesses with fewer than 20 employees , to counter complaints that many large , publicly-traded companies obtained loans in the first round . The agreement reached late Tuesday did not make that change but directed some funds to smaller banks .\nAccording to a survey of its members , the NFIB said that just half of those who have applied for loans expect that they will rehire all their workers and get the entire amount forgiven . A quarter expect that at least three-quarters of the loan will be forgiven , while 15 % didn ’ t know .\nThe American Sustainable Business Council and several other small business groups are pushing to have the starting date for rehiring shifted from the date a company received a loan to the date it can legally reopen . Many restaurants , gyms , and movie theaters have been shut down by the state .\nAdam Rammel received a $ 160,000 loan for his restaurant and bar in Bellefontaine , Ohio , near Columbus , though he ’ s uncertain about how many of his 17 laid-off staffers he will be able to rehire and when . Even when Ohio ends its restaurant shutdown , Rammel expects to face restrictions on how many people his place , Brewfontaine , can have on the premises .\n“ We have a small restaurant — we usually pack 90 to 100 in and they ’ re on top of each other . If everyone has to be six feet apart , with 40 or 45 ( customers ) we can ’ t pay the bills , ” Rammel said . He expects to bring his employees back slowly .\nAccounting firm Isdaner & Co. , based near Philadelphia , said in a client note that “ some employers will decide not to sign their loan agreement because their business is essentially closed and choose not to pay their employees for not working . ”\nLaury Hammel owns six gyms in Massachusetts , New Hampshire and Salt Lake City and employs about 480 workers . He doubts he will be able to reopen his Massachusetts locations within eight weeks , so rehiring workers now would simply force him to lay them all off again . And he ’ d be left with no money to pay them when he eventually does re-open .\nHammel is using some of the loan he received to pay for his former workers ’ health care coverage , which can be forgiven . If he doesn ’ t use 75 % on rehiring his employees , he may accept the rest as a loan . His bank doesn ’ t want to carry the loan , however , so he may try and return the money .\n“ The process leaves ( small businesses ) cash-poor at the time when they have to re-open , ” Hammel said . “ Me having the money and paying people to not come to work doesn ’ t help my business one iota . ”",

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Some small businesses that obtained a highly-coveted government loan say they won’t be able to use it to bring all their laid-off workers back, even though that is what the program was designed to do.\n\nThe Paycheck Protection Program promises a business owner loan forgiveness if they retain or rehire all the workers they had in late February. But owners say the equation isn’t so simple, in part because of current economic conditions and partly due to the terms of the loans.\n\nAs a result, the lending may not reduce unemployment as much as the Trump administration and Congress hope.\n\nThe government’s $2 trillion relief package included $349 billion for the small business loan program, which was besieged with applications and ran out of money Thursday . Congress and the White House reached a deal Tuesday that would provide another $310 billion.\n\nTo get the loans forgiven, companies need to spend 75% on payroll within eight weeks of receiving the money. The other 25% can be spent on rent, utilities, and mortgage payments. Otherwise, the loan has generous terms: Only a 1% interest rate and six months before any principal is due.\n\nMany of the small companies that were able to obtain a loan are having second thoughts about rehiring all their workers and a few plan to return the money. Others will use what they can on rent and utilities, and will use some to rehire a portion of their laid-off staff. But most are unsure they will be able to reopen eight weeks from now. They see little point in rehiring all their workers, paying them to do little or nothing, and then potentially laying them off again if business remains weak two months from now.\n\n“You’re turning the business into a pass through for the federal government,” said Joe Walsh, who owns Clean Green Maine, a cleaning service in Portland, Maine with 35 employees. “You’re doing very little to actually help the business.”\n\nIt’s unclear how much the small business lending program can hold back the surge in joblessness — a record 22 million people sought unemployment aid in the past month. Most economists forecast the unemployment rate will reach between 15% and 20% when the monthly jobs report is released in early May.\n\nMore money is clearly needed: Roughly 1.6 million small companies were able to obtain loans, the Small Business Administration said, out of at least 6 million that were likely eligible, according to Census data. Bank of America economists estimate that another $650 billion would be necessary to meet demand.\n\nAlso, the generous unemployment aid that was also included in the government’s relief package has made it more difficult to rehire. Many workers are making more with unemployment checks, which now include a $600 weekly benefit from the federal government.\n\nWalsh, who received a $280,000 loan from the SBA, said that he is reluctant to push his employees to return to work because, under unemployment benefit rules, they could lose their weekly checks if they turn down potential jobs.\n\n“That’s just putting me as the employer in a really difficult position,” Walsh said. He pays at least $17 an hour, with benefits, but his former employees are getting the equivalent of roughly $25 an hour from unemployment.\n\nRight now, Walsh’s business is closed due to lack of demand for cleaning services. He hopes to reopen soon and bring back some workers, retrain them on new sanitizing processes, and earn a bit of revenue. Still, he doubts his business will be anywhere close to what it was anytime soon, which means his workforce won’t be either.\n\n“There’s no way that I’m getting to 100% employment by the end of 8 weeks,” he said.\n\nThe National Federation for Independent Business, a small business advocacy group, is pushing the government to make it easier for loans to be forgiven.\n\nThe group wants the SBA to eliminate the requirement that 75% be spent on payroll, or at least reduce it to 50%. It also wants the rehiring window extended beyond eight weeks and is pushing for a “good faith” provision that would credit companies for trying to rehire workers who prefer unemployment aid instead.\n\nThe NFIB also asked that half the next round of funding be reserved for businesses with fewer than 20 employees, to counter complaints that many large, publicly-traded companies obtained loans in the first round. The agreement reached late Tuesday did not make that change but directed some funds to smaller banks.\n\nAccording to a survey of its members, the NFIB said that just half of those who have applied for loans expect that they will rehire all their workers and get the entire amount forgiven. A quarter expect that at least three-quarters of the loan will be forgiven, while 15% didn’t know.\n\nThe American Sustainable Business Council and several other small business groups are pushing to have the starting date for rehiring shifted from the date a company received a loan to the date it can legally reopen. Many restaurants, gyms, and movie theaters have been shut down by the state.\n\nAdam Rammel received a $160,000 loan for his restaurant and bar in Bellefontaine, Ohio, near Columbus, though he’s uncertain about how many of his 17 laid-off staffers he will be able to rehire and when. Even when Ohio ends its restaurant shutdown, Rammel expects to face restrictions on how many people his place, Brewfontaine, can have on the premises.\n\n“We have a small restaurant — we usually pack 90 to 100 in and they’re on top of each other. If everyone has to be six feet apart, with 40 or 45 (customers) we can’t pay the bills,” Rammel said. He expects to bring his employees back slowly.\n\nAccounting firm Isdaner & Co., based near Philadelphia, said in a client note that “some employers will decide not to sign their loan agreement because their business is essentially closed and choose not to pay their employees for not working.”\n\nLaury Hammel owns six gyms in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Salt Lake City and employs about 480 workers. He doubts he will be able to reopen his Massachusetts locations within eight weeks, so rehiring workers now would simply force him to lay them all off again. And he’d be left with no money to pay them when he eventually does re-open.\n\nHammel is using some of the loan he received to pay for his former workers’ health care coverage, which can be forgiven. If he doesn’t use 75% on rehiring his employees, he may accept the rest as a loan. His bank doesn’t want to carry the loan, however, so he may try and return the money.\n\n“The process leaves (small businesses) cash-poor at the time when they have to re-open,” Hammel said. “Me having the money and paying people to not come to work doesn’t help my business one iota.”\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Joyce M.

She said the defendants had “not provided evidence that they were unable to comply with the preliminary injunction, and the evidence shows only minimal efforts to comply with the preliminary injunction.”\n\nThe Education Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLawyers for the former Corinthian students called the ruling a “rare and powerful action” that provides consequences for the “extreme harm” DeVos caused.\n\nDeVos “repeatedly and brazenly violated the law to collect for-profit college students’ debts and deny their rights, and today she has been held accountable,” said Toby Merrill, director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending, which helped file the suit. “The judge is sending a loud and clear message: Students have rights under the law, and DeVos’ illegal and reckless violation of their rights will not be tolerated.”\n\nIn her ruling, the judge said the department sent just a single, three-sentence email with instructions to loan servicers, along with an “equally cursory” email to certain borrowers. There were no meetings or phone calls, Kim wrote, and little effort to make sure loan servicers received the emails.\n\nThe judge threatened to impose further sanctions if the department fails to follow her order, saying she would appoint a court official to serve as “special master” to help enforce the injunction.\n\nThe $100,000 fine will repay students for expenses they incurred to raise the issue to the court. The fine is to be paid by the department, not by DeVos personally.",

         "I can not wait to learn more about the identity and motives of the secret whistleblower who figures so prominently in stories of Trump ’ s phone call with the newly elected Ukrainian president . The narrative that began a month ago , as an insider ’ s accusation of Trump ’ s threat to cut off U.S. military aid unless investigations were launched into his expected opponent Joe Biden , has evolved considerably .\nIt now appears — in spite of initial denials — that the whistleblower consulted with House Intelligence Committee ( HIC ) staff before filing his complaint — and was advised immediately to obtain counsel . Somehow , the chosen counsel was part of a whistleblower search organization , whose staff had previously worked with HIC chairman Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) . While the whistleblower ’ s complaint was based entirely on secondhand hearsay — which was explicitly precluded under existing reporting rules — those rules were changed after the complaint ’ s receipt so as to do away with the requirement of firsthand knowledge .\nWhat began as an admission that the whistleblower worked for the CIA and was a registered Democrat was accompanied by the absolute assurance that he was not an active partisan and had not worked in any current presidential campaign . That assurance now seems to be evolving into a situation in which the whistleblower had been assigned to the National Security Council , where he worked with former Vice President Biden — and may even have traveled with him on one or more trips to Ukraine .\nWords are being chosen quite carefully , and the truth seems more and more elusive , as Republican HIC members continue to be kept in the dark . One is reminded of Lewis Carroll ’ s Alice in Wonderland , in which Alice exclaims , “ Curiouser and curiouser ! ”\nWhile the mainstream media continues to provide breathless coverage as events unfold , they evidence a strong disinclination to ferret out more information regarding the whistleblower ’ s actual identity or motives in coming forward — almost relishing the idea that HIC hearings can feature his testimony ( whether he is actually present or not ) without his identity ever becoming known .\nThe obvious parallel is to “ Deep Throat , ” Woodward and Bernstein ’ s alleged secret source for many of their Watergate revelations , whose identity remained not only secret but also an integral part of Georgetown cocktail conversation for the next 30 years .\nFor those not living through the halcyon days of Watergate , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein became famous for their series of revelations regarding the status of prosecutors ’ ongoing Watergate investigations , but it was not until their 1974 book , All the President ’ s Men , that they credited a secret source they claimed to have referred to as “ Deep Throat , ” after a popular pornographic movie character . The more recent backstory is that their publisher at Simon & Schuster had encouraged them to add more drama to their proposed book , which is how the term first came into being . In short , Deep Throat was not a term used in print or even newsroom discussions before it first appeared in their book — as their calculatedly mysterious source .\nRegardless , speculation about just who Deep Throat might be was a dominant feature of Washington gossip for the ensuing decades . Possible candidates were inevitably confined to those who had served on President Nixon ’ s White House staff , including his Chief of Staff Alexander Haig , one of his many lawyers ( John Dean , Fred Fielding , Len Garment , or Fred Buzhardt ) , one of his speechwriters ( Bill Safire , David Gergen , or Ben Stein ) , or one of other young White House aides ( including Diane Sawyer , Jonathan Rose , or Jeff Donfeld ) . Even Henry Kissinger ’ s name occasionally surfaced in the unending speculation .\nThe common theme was that Deep Throat had become so disgusted with Nixon ’ s conduct that the need to reveal the wrongdoing far outweighed any idea of loyalty to the president . This was in spite of the fact that my boss and Nixon ’ s lead Watergate defense counsel thought at the time that the leaks were coming from Mark Felt at the FBI . This belief was accompanied by the recognition that we weren ’ t in a position to do much about it , since pressuring Felt might result in even more leaks . In fact , there is a humorous conversation on the White House tapes in which Haig suggests to Nixon that Felt is the one doing the leaking — and characterizes him as “ the white rat. ” Haig goes on to explain that ’ s what Felt is called behind his back at the Bureau : He has a long face and a rather sallow complexion . “ Well , Mr. President , he looks like a rat , ” is how Haig finally sums it up .\nFor decades afterwards , when I would mention that I had worked on Nixon ’ s White House staff , people would inevitably ask if I knew who Deep Throat was . When I answered in the affirmative , they would get all excited — until I said it was Mark Felt , the white rat .

For his part , Felt was way too senile to provide any real confirmation . More significantly , it turned out that Felt had no animosity toward President Nixon ; his leaks were designed to show that Acting FBI Director Patrick Gray couldn ’ t control the FBI and should be replaced by then–Deputy Director Felt .\nWhy , then , had all of the media been so certain for the prior three decades that Deep Throat simply had to be a disillusioned Nixon White House staffer ? Following Felt ’ s 2005 outing , I went back and re-read All the President ’ s Men and then compared the book to the subsequent movie version — only to discover tantalizing differences in Deep Throat ’ s treatment .\nIn their book , there is no implication whatsoever that Deep Throat is a White House employee . The authors were very careful not to give any hint at all as to his place of employment . The movie version , however , differs considerably — with implied White House employment occurring in three separate scenes : First , relatively early on , Woodward ( played by Robert Redford ) and Bernstein ( played by Dustin Hoffman ) are shown on the Library of Congress steps , lamenting that they are out of leads . Redford offers up the idea that he has a contact at the Nixon White House — and their paucity of leads quickly evaporates . Second , at one point , Redford calls Deep Throat ( played by Hal Holbrook ) at work .

         "The New York Times has decided to blame the El Paso murders not on the actual killer but on “ conservative media stars. ” As here .\nSpecifically , by name , that would be the Fox News evening lineup of Tucker Carlson , Sean Hannity , and Laura Ingraham . Then it goes on to talk radio ’ s Rush Limbaugh , plus Fox and Friends ’ Brian Kilmeade , Fox ’ s Jeanine Pirro , and Ann Coulter . Thrown in along the way were “ outlets like Sinclair Broadcast Group and The Drudge Report to platforms like Breitbart News and Gateway Pundit , ” with a specific mention of Sinclair ’ s Boris Epshteyn .

They are either complacent or involved in one of the biggest betrayals of the American public in our history . The takeover of the United States government by unchecked corporations .\nWhere would the killer get such an idea ? Where would he pick up such anti-corporate language ?\nHe could start by reading this November 25 , 2018 column by New York Times opinion columnist David Leonhardt titled :\nThe Monopolization of America In one industry after another , big companies have become more dominant over the past 15 years , new data show .\nIn which the Times columnist says this ( bold print supplied ) :\nHostility to corporate bigness animated Thomas Jefferson and Teddy Roosevelt , as well as the labor movement , Granger movement , Progressive movement and more . Of course , monopolies and other corporate giants have fought back against these assaults on their power , and sometimes succeeded for years or decades at a time . It happened during the age of Rockefeller and Morgan . Over the past 40 years , it has happened again . The federal government , under presidents of both parties , has largely surrendered to monopoly power . “ The ‘ anti ’ in ‘ antitrust ’ has been discarded , ” as the legal scholar Tim Wu puts it in his new book , “ The Curse of Bigness. ” Washington allows most megamergers to proceed either straight up or with only fig-leaf changes . The government has also done nothing to prevent the emergence of dominant new technology companies that mimic the old AT & T monopoly .\nThen there was this language by another Times columnist , Farhad Manjoo , assailing five specific corporations :\nIn which Manjoo says this of big corporations “ Amazon , Apple , Facebook , Microsoft and Alphabet , the parent company of Google ” :\nThis is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism : We are , all of us , in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy .\nManjoo closes by saying this of the dominance by these five giant corporations : “ It ’ s too late to escape . ”\nNot to be left out is this Times jewel assailing corporations , this one written by Steven Davidoff Solomon , identified as “ a professor of law at the University of California , Berkeley. ” The Times published Professor Solomon as saying this of big corporations and their use of “ corporate inversions ” :\nIf you thought there was a problem with inversions — deals that allow American companies to relocate their headquarters to lower their tax bills — wait until you hear about the real secret to avoiding corporate taxes . It ’ s called earnings stripping , and it is a technique that the Obama administration has so far failed to stop . The public outcry over the use of inversions is now entering its third year . Pfizer is trying the biggest one yet , a $ 152 billion deal for Allergan , the maker of Botox , which is based in Dublin . The flight of American icons like Pfizer has led to complaints that corporations are gaming the system to lower the taxes they pay to Washington . At the same time , the companies stay in the United States , getting all the benefits of our country .\nOne could go on and on with examples of New York Times language assailing the power of corporations , their evasions of taxes , and more . Language that matches exactly the language of the El Paso shooter . But let ’ s move on to Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .\nWarren , it turns out , had a fan in the Dayton , Ohio , shooter . And Warren ’ s language on corporations and their power couldn ’ t be missed . Examples ?\nHere is the Atlantic running a piece on Warren ’ s views on corporate power as written by Stacy Mitchell , “ Co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. ” The headline :\nThe Atlantic story says that Warren believes “ that big corporations ’ political influence and market dominance are killing smaller rivals , and that small-business owners share interests with other victims of corporate power . ”\nReplying to Mitt Romney ’ s statement in 2008 that “ corporations are people , ” Warren said :\nNo , Governor Romney , corporations are not people . People have hearts , they have kids , they get jobs , they get sick , they love , and they die . And that matters . That matter because we don ’ t run this country for corporations , we run it for people . People feel the system is rigged against them . And here ’ s the painful part . They ’ re right . The system is rigged . Look around . Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies . Wall Street CEOs — the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs — still strut around Congress , no shame , demanding favors , and acting like we should thank them .\nThere is infinitely more of Warren assailing corporate power , but let ’ s move to Bernie Sanders . Here is Sanders saying this on page 273 of his book Our Revolution :\nCorporate tax reform must start by preventing profitable companies from sheltering profits in tax haven countries like the Cayman Islands . In 2015 , I introduced legislation with Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois to do just that . The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would end the loophole that allows corporations to defer paying taxes on overseas profits . Instead , it would require corporations to pay U.S. taxes on offshore profits as they are earned . This bill would take away the tax incentives for corporations to shift profits and move jobs and factories offshore , by taxing their profits no matter where they are generated . American corporations would continue to get a credit against their U.S. tax liability for foreign taxes they pay , but they would have to pay the federal government the difference between the foreign rate and the U.S. rate .\nAlso in the Sanders book was this attack on corporations and their control of the media :\nIn 1983 the largest fifty corporations controlled 90 percent of the media . That ’ s a high level of concentration . Today , as a result of massive mergers and takeovers , six corporations control 90 percent of what we see , hear , and read . This is outrageous , and a real threat to our democracy .\nOn and on and on I could go with attacks on corporations and corporate power by the New York Times and Senators Warren and Sanders — not to mention other Democratic presidential candidates .\nThere is no question that in both exact language and certainly in sentiment the views repeatedly expressed by the Times , Warren , and Sanders matches exactly the language and sentiment of the El Paso killer on corporations and corporate power .\nSurprise ? In this not so-cleverly disguised attack on Tucker , Sean , Laura , Rush , and the rest , the Times mentions nary a peep of the similarity in language between the shooter ’ s “ manifesto ” and the Times itself , as well as Warren and Sanders . Say again : not … a … single … word .\nThe obvious conclusion ? The left-wing paper wanted to shift responsibility for the shooting from the shooter and blame the stars of conservative media .\nBut in playing this game the New York Times managed to hit a decidedly unintended target : the New York Times itself .",
         "Backfire.\n\nThe New York Times has decided to blame the El Paso murders not on the actual killer but on “conservative media stars.” As here.\n\nSpecifically, by name, that would be the Fox News evening lineup of Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham. Then it goes on to talk radio’s Rush Limbaugh, plus Fox and Friends’ Brian Kilmeade, Fox’s Jeanine Pirro, and Ann Coulter.

And oh yes, there was a reference to former Nixon and Reagan aide and columnist Pat Buchanan.\n\nSuffice to say, the smear instantly backfired on the Times itself. Big time.\n\nLet’s start with the Times’ reasoning on this smear:\n\nThere is a striking degree of overlap between the words of right-wing media personalities and the language used by the Texas man who confessed to killing 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso this month. In a 2,300-word screed posted on the website 8chan, the killer wrote that he was “simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion.”\n\nGot that? There was a “striking degree of overlap” between the language of these conservative media stars and “the language used by” the El Paso killer in his so-called “manifesto.”\n\nWell, now. What did the Times story mysteriously leave out? This.\n\nTo borrow from the Times, “There is a striking degree of overlap between the words of left-wing Democratic presidential candidates and the New York Times and the language used by” the Texas shooter.\n\nLet’s get specific. Says the killer:\n\nThe inconvenient truth is that our leaders, both Democrat AND Republican, have been failing us for decades. They are either complacent or involved in one of the biggest betrayals of the American public in our history. The takeover of the United States government by unchecked corporations.\n\nWhere would the killer get such an idea? Where would he pick up such anti-corporate language?\n\nHe could start by reading this November 25, 2018 column by New York Times opinion columnist David Leonhardt titled:\n\nThe Monopolization of America In one industry after another, big companies have become more dominant over the past 15 years, new data show.\n\nIn which the Times columnist says this (bold print supplied):\n\nHostility to corporate bigness animated Thomas Jefferson and Teddy Roosevelt, as well as the labor movement, Granger movement, Progressive movement and more. Of course, monopolies and other corporate giants have fought back against these assaults on their power, and sometimes succeeded for years or decades at a time.

The government has also done nothing to prevent the emergence of dominant new technology companies that mimic the old AT&T monopoly.\n\nThen there was this language by another Times columnist, Farhad Manjoo, assailing five specific corporations:\n\nTech’s Frightful Five: They’ve Got Us\n\nIn which Manjoo says this of big corporations “Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google”:\n\nThis is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy.\n\nManjoo closes by saying this of the dominance by these five giant corporations: “It’s too late to escape.”\n\nNot to be left out is this Times jewel assailing corporations, this one written by Steven Davidoff Solomon, identified as “a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.” The Times published Professor Solomon as saying this of big corporations and their use of “corporate inversions”:\n\nIf you thought there was a problem with inversions — deals that allow American companies to relocate their headquarters to lower their tax bills — wait until you hear about the real secret to avoiding corporate taxes.

Pfizer is trying the biggest one yet, a $152 billion deal for Allergan, the maker of Botox, which is based in Dublin. The flight of American icons like Pfizer has led to complaints that corporations are gaming the system to lower the taxes they pay to Washington. At the same time, the companies stay in the United States, getting all the benefits of our country.\n\nOne could go on and on with examples of New York Times language assailing the power of corporations, their evasions of taxes, and more. Language that matches exactly the language of the El Paso shooter. But let’s move on to Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nWarren, it turns out, had a fan in the Dayton, Ohio, shooter. And Warren’s language on corporations and their power couldn’t be missed. Examples?\n\nHere is the Atlantic running a piece on Warren’s views on corporate power as written by Stacy Mitchell, “Co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.” The headline:\n\nElizabeth Warren Has a Theory About Corporate Power\n\nThe Atlantic story says that Warren believes “that big corporations’ political influence and market dominance are killing smaller rivals, and that small-business owners share interests with other victims of corporate power.”\n\nReplying to Mitt Romney’s statement in 2008 that “corporations are people,” Warren said:\n\nNo, Governor Romney, corporations are not people. People have hearts, they have kids, they get jobs, they get sick, they love, and they die. And that matters. That matter because we don’t run this country for corporations, we run it for people. People feel the system is rigged against them. And here’s the painful part. They’re right. The system is rigged. Look around. Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies. Wall Street CEOs — the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs — still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them.\n\nThere is infinitely more of Warren assailing corporate power, but let’s move to Bernie Sanders. Here is Sanders saying this on page 273 of his book Our Revolution:\n\nCorporate tax reform must start by preventing profitable companies from sheltering profits in tax haven countries like the Cayman Islands. In 2015, I introduced legislation with Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois to do just that. The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would end the loophole that allows corporations to defer paying taxes on overseas profits. Instead, it would require corporations to pay U.S. taxes on offshore profits as they are earned. This bill would take away the tax incentives for corporations to shift profits and move jobs and factories offshore, by taxing their profits no matter where they are generated. American corporations would continue to get a credit against their U.S. tax liability for foreign taxes they pay, but they would have to pay the federal government the difference between the foreign rate and the U.S. rate.\n\nAlso in the Sanders book was this attack on corporations and their control of the media:\n\nIn 1983 the largest fifty corporations controlled 90 percent of the media. That’s a high level of concentration. Today, as a result of massive mergers and takeovers, six corporations control 90 percent of what we see, hear, and read. This is outrageous, and a real threat to our democracy.\n\nOn and on and on I could go with attacks on corporations and corporate power by the New York Times and Senators Warren and Sanders — not to mention other Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nThere is no question that in both exact language and certainly in sentiment the views repeatedly expressed by the Times, Warren, and Sanders matches exactly the language and sentiment of the El Paso killer on corporations and corporate power.\n\nSurprise? In this not so-cleverly disguised attack on Tucker, Sean, Laura, Rush, and the rest, the Times mentions nary a peep of the similarity in language between the shooter’s “manifesto” and the Times itself, as well as Warren and Sanders. Say again: not … a … single … word.\n\nThe obvious conclusion? The left-wing paper wanted to shift responsibility for the shooting from the shooter and blame the stars of conservative media.\n\nBut in playing this game the New York Times managed to hit a decidedly unintended target: the New York Times itself.\n\nOops!",

         "WASHINGTON – For the first time in his presidency , Donald Trump gave his State of the Union address to a divided Congress . The president did n't flinch as he faced a House of Representatives led by Democrats who have recently pushed for late-term abortions .\nTrump boldly pushed back on that agenda , saying America 's leaders need to `` work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life . '' The president then called on Congress to pass legislation to prohibit late-term abortions .\n`` Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother 's womb moments before birth , '' Trump said . `` These are living , feeling , beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world . ''\n`` And then , we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth , '' the president continued . `` All children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of God . ''\nThe commander in chief also broke down his vision for safe and legal immigration , demanding a wall be constructed along America 's southern border .\nHe illustrated his point by hosting the family members of Gerald and Sharon David , an elderly couple murdered in their Nevada home just last month by an immigrant who was in the US illegally .\n`` I will never forget , and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon , that it should never happen again , '' Trump said . `` Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border . ''\n`` Simply put – walls save lives , '' he stated . `` In the past , most people in this room voted for a wall – but the proper wall never got built . I 'll get it built . ''\nMeanwhile , the future of the wall still remains in question as congressional negotiators continue to work on a deal to prevent another government shutdown .\nIn the Democrats ' response to the president 's address , former Georgia governor candidate Stacey Abrams placed blame for the recent closing of the government directly on the president .\n`` The shutdown was a stunt engineered by the President of the United States , one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people – but our values , '' she charged .\nTrump struck a bipartisan tone when talking about rebuilding America , fighting cancer , eradicating HIV , lowering the cost of healthcare and his handling of the economy .\n`` An economic miracle is happening in the United States , '' he declared . `` The only thing that can stop it are foolish wars , politics , or ridiculous partisan investigations .

         "As a first step , I believe it necessary for the members and leadership of the Democratic National Committee to step down and be replaced by people who are determined to create a party that represents America – including all those who feel powerless and disenfranchised , and who have been left out of our politics and left behind in our economy .\nThe Democratic Party as it is now constituted has become a giant fundraising machine , too often reflecting the goals and values of the moneyed interests . This must change . The election of 2016 has repudiated it . We need a people ’ s party – a party capable of organizing and mobilizing Americans in opposition to Donald Trump ’ s Republican party , which is about to take over all three branches of the U.S. government . We need a New Democratic Party that will fight against intolerance and widening inequality .\nWhat happened in America Tuesday should not be seen as a victory for hatefulness over decency . It is more accurately understood as a repudiation of the American power structure .\nAt the core of that structure are the political leaders of both parties , their political operatives , and fundraisers ; the major media , centered in New York and Washington DC ; the country ’ s biggest corporations , their top executives , and Washington lobbyists and trade associations ; the biggest Wall Street banks , their top officers , traders , hedge-fund and private-equity managers , and their lackeys in Washington ; and the wealthy individuals who invest directly in politics .\nAt the start of the 2016 election cycle , this power structure proclaimed Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush shoo-ins for the nominations of the Democratic and Republican parties . After all , both of these individuals had deep bases of funders , well-established networks of political insiders , experienced political advisers and all the political name recognition any candidate could possibly want .\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the White House . The presidency was won by Donald Trump , who made his fortune marketing office towers and casinos , and , more recently , starring in a popular reality-television program , and who has never held elective office or had anything to do with the Republican party . Hillary Clinton narrowly won the popular vote , but not enough of the states and their electors secure a victory .\nHillary Clinton ’ s defeat is all the more remarkable in that her campaign vastly outspent the Trump campaign on television and radio advertisements , and get-out-the-vote efforts . Moreover , her campaign had the support in the general election not of only the kingpins of the Democratic party but also many leading Republicans , including most of the politically active denizens of Wall Street and the top executives of America ’ s largest corporations , and even former Republican president George HW Bush . Her campaign team was run by seasoned professionals who knew the ropes . She had the visible and forceful backing of Barack Obama , whose popularity has soared in recent months , and his popular wife . And , of course , she had her husband .\nTrump , by contrast , was shunned by the power structure . Mitt Romney , the Republican presidential candidate in 2012 , actively worked against Trump ’ s nomination . Many senior Republicans refused to endorse him , or even give him their support . The Republican National Committee did not raise money for Trump to the extent it had for other Republican candidates for president .\nThere had been hints of the political earthquake to come . Trump had won the Republican primaries , after all . More tellingly , Clinton had been challenged in the Democratic primaries by the unlikeliest of candidates – a 74-year-old Jewish senator from Vermont who described himself as a democratic socialist and who was not even a Democrat . Bernie Sanders went on to win 22 states and 47 percent of the vote in those primaries . Sanders ’ major theme was that the country ’ s political and economic system was rigged in favor of big corporations , Wall Street and the very wealthy .\nThe power structure of America wrote off Sanders as an aberration , and , until recently , didn ’ t take Trump seriously . A respected political insider recently told me most Americans were largely content with the status quo . “ The economy is in good shape , ” he said . “ Most Americans are better off than they ’ ve been in years . ”\nRecent economic indicators may be up , but those indicators don ’ t reflect the insecurity most Americans continue to feel , nor the seeming arbitrariness and unfairness they experience . Nor do the major indicators show the linkages many Americans see between wealth and power , stagnant or declining real wages , soaring CEO pay , and the undermining of democracy by big money .\nMedian family income is lower now than it was 16 years ago , adjusted for inflation . Workers without college degrees – the old working class – have fallen furthest . Most economic gains , meanwhile , have gone to top . These gains have translated into political power to elicit bank bailouts , corporate subsidies , special tax loopholes , favorable trade deals and increasing market power without interference by anti-monopoly enforcement – all of which have further reduced wages and pulled up profits .\nWealth , power and crony capitalism fit together . Americans know a takeover has occurred , and they blame the establishment for it .\nThe Democratic party once represented the working class . But over the last three decades the party has been taken over by Washington-based fundraisers , bundlers , analysts , and pollsters who have focused instead on raising campaign money from corporate and Wall Street executives and getting votes from upper middle-class households in “ swing ” suburbs .\nDemocrats have occupied the White House for 16 of the last 24 years , and for four of those years had control of both houses of Congress . But in that time they failed to reverse the decline in working-class wages and economic security . Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ardently pushed for free trade agreements without providing millions of blue-collar workers who thereby lost their jobs means of getting new ones that paid at least as well .\nThey stood by as corporations hammered trade unions , the backbone of the white working class – failing to reform labor laws to impose meaningful penalties on companies that violate them , or help workers form unions with simple up-or-down votes . Partly as a result , union membership sank from 22 percent of all workers when Bill Clinton was elected president to less than 12 percenttoday , and the working class lost bargaining leverage to get a share of the economy ’ s gains .\nBill Clinton and Obama also allowed antitrust enforcement to ossify – with the result that large corporations have grown far larger , and major industries more concentrated . The unsurprising result of this combination – more trade , declining unionization and more industry concentration – has been to shift political and economic power to big corporations and the wealthy , and to shaft the working class . This created an opening for Donald Trump ’ s authoritarian demagoguery , and his presidency .\nNow Americans have rebelled by supporting someone who wants to fortify America against foreigners as well as foreign-made goods . The power structure understandably fears that Trump ’ s isolationism will stymie economic growth . But most Americans couldn ’ t care less about growth because for years they have received few of its benefits , while suffering most of its burdens in the forms of lost jobs and lower wages .\nThe power structure is shocked by the outcome of the 2016 election because it has cut itself off from the lives of most Americans . Perhaps it also doesn ’ t wish to understand , because that would mean acknowledging its role in enabling the presidency of Donald Trump .\nRobert Reich , one of the nation ’ s leading experts on work and the economy , is Chancellor ’ s Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley . He has served in three national administrations , most recently as secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton . Time Magazine has named him one of the ten most effective cabinet secretaries of the last century . He has written 13 books , including his latest best-seller , “ Aftershock : The Next Economy and America ’ s Future ; ” “ The Work of Nations , ” which has been translated into 22 languages ; and his newest , an e-book , “ Beyond Outrage. ” His syndicated columns , television appearances , and public radio commentaries reach millions of people each week . He is also a founding editor of the American Prospect magazine , and Chairman of the citizen ’ s group Common Cause . His new movie `` Inequality for All '' is in Theaters .

The unsurprising result of this combination – more trade, declining unionization and more industry concentration – has been to shift political and economic power to big corporations and the wealthy, and to shaft the working class. This created an opening for Donald Trump’s authoritarian demagoguery, and his presidency.\n\nNow Americans have rebelled by supporting someone who wants to fortify America against foreigners as well as foreign-made goods. The power structure understandably fears that Trump’s isolationism will stymie economic growth. But most Americans couldn’t care less about growth because for years they have received few of its benefits, while suffering most of its burdens in the forms of lost jobs and lower wages.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe power structure is shocked by the outcome of the 2016 election because it has cut itself off from the lives of most Americans. Perhaps it also doesn’t wish to understand, because that would mean acknowledging its role in enabling the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nRobert Reich, one of the nation’s leading experts on work and the economy, is Chancellor’s Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley.

         "After 10 years of silence - a decade of dodging questions about the infamous stain on her blue dress and the jokes about the president's cigar - Bill Clinton's mistress, Monica Lewinsky, spoke out in Vanity Fair.\n\nRemembering the Monica Lewinsky Scandal\n\nHere's what she had to say:\n\n1. She May Not Stay Quiet if Hillary Runs\n\nLewinsky says she \"remained virtually reclusive\" during Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign despite repeated interview requests. Now that Hillary is reportedly mulling a 2016 bid, Lewinsky finds herself \"gun-shy yet again, fearful of 'becoming an issue' should she decide to ramp up her campaign.\" But she's not sure she'll stay quiet this time.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who says she's still recognized everywhere she goes, has had enough of \"tiptoeing around my past - and other people's futures.\"\n\nSo though she acknowledges speaking out may have severe ramifications, \"I've decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past … It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress.\"\n\n2. What She Finds 'Troubling' About Hillary\n\nLewinsky seems to resent Hillary Clinton's reaction - and rejects the then-first lady's characterization of her as a \" narcissistic loony toon.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Clinton, I read, had supposedly confided to [Diane] Blair that, in part, she blamed herself for her husband's affair (by being emotionally neglectful) and seemed to forgive him … I find her impulse to blame the Woman - not only me, but herself - troubling,\" Lewinsky argues.\n\nHer refusal to cooperate with interrogators may have been \"courageous or foolish,\" she admits. \"But narcissistic and loony?\" No way.\n\n3. The Relationship Was Consensual\n\nLewinsky maintains that her relationship with Clinton was voluntary.\n\n\"Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship,\" Lewinsky writes. \"Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position.\"\n\nNevertheless, she says, she \"regrets\" the relationship. \"Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened.,\" she writes.\n\n4. The Clintons Didn't Pay Her Off\n\nThe Clintons didn't bribe her to stay quiet, Lewinsky insists.\n\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" she writes. She turned down $10 million-plus \"offers\" (presumably interview requests) \"because they didn't feel like the right thing to do.\"\n\nHowever, money has been an issue since the incident. Lewinsky pursued a career in marketing, but \"because of what potential employers so tactfully referred to as my 'history, I was never 'quite right' for the position.\"\n\nShe has \"managed to get by (barely, at times) with my own projects… or loans from friends,\" she says.\n\n5. She Contemplated Suicide\n\nThough she never actually attempted suicide, Lewinsky says she was tempted end her own life as \"the shame, the scorn, and the fear\" washed over her.\n\nShe says the tragic suicide of 18-year-old Tyler Clementi, the gay Rutgers student who was filmed kissing another man, brought back those terrible memories and inspired her to come forward.\n\n\"Perhaps by sharing my story … I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation,\" Lewinksi says.",

         "Oliver Jj Lane",
         "The United Kingdom Supreme Court has ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was acting unlawfully when he suspended Parliament in August for five weeks , a move which anti-Brexit campaigners claimed was intended to thwart their attempts to prevent Britain leaving the European Union .\nIn a shock ruling which strongly went against the government on every count , the Supreme Court in London unanimously found Tuesday morning that Boris Johnson ’ s decision to suspend Parliament was not only unlawful but was null and void , meaning it legally did not take place . Parliament is now free to sit again as soon as desired by the speakers of both houses , the court explained .\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now reacted , speaking to the BBC on a balcony of the United Nations building in New York , insisting that despite the court ruling against him this morning Brexit would still be going ahead at the end of October as planned .\nIn remarks that have already angered remainers , the Prime Minister said he regretted the decision of the court but pointed out the coalition of anti-Brexit campaigners who have worked tirelessly to prevent Britain ’ s withdrawal from going ahead .\nAs I say , I strongly disagree with this decision of the supreme court , I have the utmost respect for our judiciary , I don ’ think this was the right decision I think that the prerogative of prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge . It is perfectly usual to have Queen ’ s speech , that ’ s what we want to do . More importantly , let ’ s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit . There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU . We have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued , doesn ’ t want to have an election , and I think it is time we took things forward . …as the law currently stands , the UK leaves the EU on October the 31st come what may , but the interesting , exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal and that ’ s what we are working on . And I ’ ll be honest with you… it is not made much easier by this kind of stuff in Parliament and the courts . Obviously getting a deal is not made much easier against this background but we ’ ve got to get on and do it . …As the law stands we leave on October the 31st and I am very hopeful that we will get a deal , and I think what the people of the country want is to see Parliamentarians coming together , working in the national interest to get this thing done , and that is what we are going to do .\nA government spokesman has said the Prime Minister will not resign , and he will return to the United Kingdom tonight after his speech to the United Nations .\nUpdate 1305 : Farage calls Boris proroguing parliament “ worst political decision ever ”\nBrexit leader Nigel Farage has no sympathy for Boris Johnson ’ s unforced error and has said his chief advisor Dominic Cummings — who has frequently crossed swords with Farage & co in the past — should step down over the affair which he is widely thought to have engineered .\nSpeaking to Breitbart London before the ruling was made , Mr Farage said : “ We have a Parliament that twice has stopped us from having a General Election and instead we have a Supreme Court making a decision as to whether Boris Johnson remains prime minister ; virtually , that ’ s how important the ruling is .\n“ I don ’ t like it one little bit and I think our whole constitution has been thrown completely up into the air by Speaker Bercow and others . ”\nRead that and the responses of other political figures at Breitbart London\nThe Supreme Court was the creation of the Blair years of government , a time of enormous constitutional and political change in the United Kingdom . As Breitbart London ’ s James Delingpole has it , the court Blair created is now doing his bidding . Read more here\nDelingpole : Judicial Enemies of the People Sabotage Brexit Again https : //t.co/GwteWW9Wyz — Breitbart London ( @ BreitbartLondon ) September 24 , 2019\nCommons speaker John Bercow has spoken to reporters outside Parliament , answering the questions over when Parliament would resume , given the Supreme Court has given it leave to do so whenever it wishes . The answer is Wednesday morning , with opportunities for members to make urgent questions , request emergency debates , and to hold ministers to account . Expect fireworks .\nBREAKING : Speaker Bercow : Parliament Will ‘ Resume ’ Wednesday After Supreme Court Nullification of Suspension https : //t.co/2kWH5SaOKa — Breitbart London ( @ BreitbartLondon ) September 24 , 2019\nAnti-Brexit politicians have leapt upon the ruling as resembling a fatal blow against Boris Johnson , who it is claimed could be the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history if he were ousted now . But what or who could replace Mr Johnson is not clear as no single party can command a majority in Parliament .\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed his party ’ s annual conference in Brighton as the ruling was made , and told the delegates there that the Prime Minister should “ consider his position ” . Speaking outside the Supreme Court former Tory MP turned independent Anna Soubry also called on the Prime Minister to resign , saying it was time for what she unironically calls a government of national unity to take power . Presumably formed of a coalition of opposition parties , the purpose of the much-discussed “ unity ” government would be to overturn Brexit , it has been claimed — despite delivering Brexit being the majority position in the United Kingdom .\nThe first question was whether the court even had the right to consider the question — a matter of jurisdiction . Some had argued the division of powers under the UK constitution meant it would not be proper for the unelected judiciary to make decisions on the acts of the executive — the government — but the court disagreed , stating they believed they had the right . In the words of Lady Brenda Hale who read out the unanimous decision of the 11 justices , the matter was “ judicable ” , and for for them to decide on .\nLady Hale explained : “ …this was not an ordinary prorogation in the run-up to a Queen ’ s speech . It prevented Parliament from carrying out its constitutional role in five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and the exit day on the 31st of October . Proroguing Parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess .\n“ While Parliament is Prorogued , neither house can meet , debate , or pass legislation . Neither house can debate government policy . Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers , or meet and take evidence in committees . ”\nOf the decision to Prorogue itself , Lady Hale said : “ The decision to ask her majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing Parliament from carrying out its constitutional functions without justification . ”\nMr Johnson had used a mechanism known in Westminster parlance as Prorogation to suspend Parliament , usually a normal and regular event in Parliamentary life , but one met this time with outrage by anti-Brexiteers . Normal Parliamentary sessions have lasted between one and two years , being regularly suspended to clear out old unfinished legislation and to allow new government programmes to be launched .\nBut amid the endless Parliamentary discussion over whether to honour the result of the 2016 referendum which saw the British people vote by a margin of over one million votes — the largest democratic mandate given in British history — this Parliamentary session has rumbled on , becoming the longest since the infamous ‘ long Parliament ’ of the English Civil War .\nThe government under Mr Johnson insisted given those circumstances , and the fact the UK government has not yet been able to introduce new domestic legislation , it was reasonable to suspend Parliament .\nAnti-Brexit activists claim the Prime Minister not only lied to the country , but lied to the Queen , as under the British constitutional system she has to be asked as a formality to suspend Parliament .\nThe Associated Press has created this handy timeline of the most recent events leading up to today , to give some context for today ’ s ruling :\nJuly 24 , 2019 : Boris Johnson becomes prime minister after winning a party leadership contest to succeed Theresa May . He vows to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 , with or without a deal .\nAugust 28 : Johnson suspends Parliament for a five-week period ending Oct. 14 . Queen Elizabeth II approves his request , as she is required to do under Britain ’ s constitutional monarchy . He says it is a routine decision to set the stage for announcement of his new domestic agenda , but House of Commons Speaker John Bercow calls it a “ constitutional outrage . ”\nAugust 29 : Activist Gina Miller launches legal action against Johnson at the High Court in London . Her case is subsequently joined by former prime minister John Major and others .\nAugust 30 : In a separate case , a judge in Scotland refuses to grant an emergency measure blocking the suspension of Parliament but schedules a full hearing at a later date .\nSeptember 4 : The Court of Session in Scotland rejects the bid to have the suspension declared unlawful .\nSeptember 5 : The High Court in London hears Miller ’ s case against the suspension . Her lawyers argue the move was an “ unlawful abuse of power ” by the prime minister .\nSeptember 6 : The High Court in London rejects Miller ’ s case . She vows to take it to the Supreme Court .\nSeptember 11 : The Inner House of the Court of Session in Scotland rules that the suspension was illegal and was intended to “ stymie ” Parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline .\nSeptember 17 : A three-day hearing on both cases begins at the Supreme Court , with 11 justices presiding .\nSeptember 24 : The Supreme Court is scheduled to announce its decision .",

It is perfectly usual to have Queen’s speech, that’s what we want to do. More importantly, let’s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit. There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU. We have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued, doesn’t want to have an election, and I think it is time we took things forward. …as the law currently stands, the UK leaves the EU on October the 31st come what may, but the interesting, exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal and that’s what we are working on. And I’ll be honest with you… it is not made much easier by this kind of stuff in Parliament and the courts. Obviously getting a deal is not made much easier against this background but we’ve got to get on and do it. …As the law stands we leave on October the 31st and I am very hopeful that we will get a deal, and I think what the people of the country want is to see Parliamentarians coming together, working in the national interest to get this thing done, and that is what we are going to do.\n\nA government spokesman has said the Prime Minister will not resign, and he will return to the United Kingdom tonight after his speech to the United Nations.\n\nUpdate 1305: Farage calls Boris proroguing parliament “worst political decision ever”\n\nBrexit leader Nigel Farage has no sympathy for Boris Johnson’s unforced error and has said his chief advisor Dominic Cummings — who has frequently crossed swords with Farage & co in the past — should step down over the affair which he is widely thought to have engineered.\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart London before the ruling was made, Mr Farage said: “We have a Parliament that twice has stopped us from having a General Election and instead we have a Supreme Court making a decision as to whether Boris Johnson remains prime minister; virtually, that’s how important the ruling is.\n\n“I don’t like it one little bit and I think our whole constitution has been thrown completely up into the air by Speaker Bercow and others.”\n\nRead that and the responses of other political figures at Breitbart London\n\nUpdate 1255: Tony Blair’s lingering influence on British politics\n\nThe Supreme Court was the creation of the Blair years of government, a time of enormous constitutional and political change in the United Kingdom. As Breitbart London’s James Delingpole has it, the court Blair created is now doing his bidding. Read more here\n\nDelingpole: Judicial Enemies of the People Sabotage Brexit Again https://t.co/GwteWW9Wyz — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 24, 2019\n\nUpdate 1220: Parliament will resume session tomorrow\n\nCommons speaker John Bercow has spoken to reporters outside Parliament, answering the questions over when Parliament would resume, given the Supreme Court has given it leave to do so whenever it wishes. The answer is Wednesday morning, with opportunities for members to make urgent questions, request emergency debates, and to hold ministers to account. Expect fireworks.\n\nBREAKING: Speaker Bercow: Parliament Will ‘Resume’ Wednesday After Supreme Court Nullification of Suspension https://t.co/2kWH5SaOKa — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 24, 2019\n\nUpdate 1115: Calls for the Prime Minister to resign\n\nAnti-Brexit politicians have leapt upon the ruling as resembling a fatal blow against Boris Johnson, who it is claimed could be the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history if he were ousted now. But what or who could replace Mr Johnson is not clear as no single party can command a majority in Parliament.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed his party’s annual conference in Brighton as the ruling was made, and told the delegates there that the Prime Minister should “consider his position”. Speaking outside the Supreme Court former Tory MP turned independent Anna Soubry also called on the Prime Minister to resign, saying it was time for what she unironically calls a government of national unity to take power. Presumably formed of a coalition of opposition parties, the purpose of the much-discussed “unity” government would be to overturn Brexit, it has been claimed — despite delivering Brexit being the majority position in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe original story continues below:\n\nThe first question was whether the court even had the right to consider the question — a matter of jurisdiction. Some had argued the division of powers under the UK constitution meant it would not be proper for the unelected judiciary to make decisions on the acts of the executive — the government — but the court disagreed, stating they believed they had the right. In the words of Lady Brenda Hale who read out the unanimous decision of the 11 justices, the matter was “judicable”, and for for them to decide on.\n\nLady Hale explained: “…this was not an ordinary prorogation in the run-up to a Queen’s speech. It prevented Parliament from carrying out its constitutional role in five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and the exit day on the 31st of October. Proroguing Parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess.\n\n“While Parliament is Prorogued, neither house can meet, debate, or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers, or meet and take evidence in committees.”\n\nOf the decision to Prorogue itself, Lady Hale said: “The decision to ask her majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing Parliament from carrying out its constitutional functions without justification.”\n\nMr Johnson had used a mechanism known in Westminster parlance as Prorogation to suspend Parliament, usually a normal and regular event in Parliamentary life, but one met this time with outrage by anti-Brexiteers. Normal Parliamentary sessions have lasted between one and two years, being regularly suspended to clear out old unfinished legislation and to allow new government programmes to be launched.\n\nBut amid the endless Parliamentary discussion over whether to honour the result of the 2016 referendum which saw the British people vote by a margin of over one million votes — the largest democratic mandate given in British history — this Parliamentary session has rumbled on, becoming the longest since the infamous ‘long Parliament’ of the English Civil War.\n\nThe government under Mr Johnson insisted given those circumstances, and the fact the UK government has not yet been able to introduce new domestic legislation, it was reasonable to suspend Parliament.\n\nAnti-Brexit activists claim the Prime Minister not only lied to the country, but lied to the Queen, as under the British constitutional system she has to be asked as a formality to suspend Parliament.\n\nThe Associated Press has created this handy timeline of the most recent events leading up to today, to give some context for today’s ruling:\n\nJuly 24, 2019: Boris Johnson becomes prime minister after winning a party leadership contest to succeed Theresa May. He vows to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.\n\nAugust 28: Johnson suspends Parliament for a five-week period ending Oct. 14. Queen Elizabeth II approves his request, as she is required to do under Britain’s constitutional monarchy. He says it is a routine decision to set the stage for announcement of his new domestic agenda, but House of Commons Speaker John Bercow calls it a “constitutional outrage.”\n\nAugust 29: Activist Gina Miller launches legal action against Johnson at the High Court in London. Her case is subsequently joined by former prime minister John Major and others.\n\nAugust 30: In a separate case, a judge in Scotland refuses to grant an emergency measure blocking the suspension of Parliament but schedules a full hearing at a later date.\n\nSeptember 4: The Court of Session in Scotland rejects the bid to have the suspension declared unlawful.\n\nSeptember 5: The High Court in London hears Miller’s case against the suspension. Her lawyers argue the move was an “unlawful abuse of power” by the prime minister.\n\nSeptember 6: The High Court in London rejects Miller’s case. She vows to take it to the Supreme Court.\n\nSeptember 11: The Inner House of the Court of Session in Scotland rules that the suspension was illegal and was intended to “stymie” Parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline.\n\nSeptember 17: A three-day hearing on both cases begins at the Supreme Court, with 11 justices presiding.\n\nSeptember 24: The Supreme Court is scheduled to announce its decision.",

         "The horrific story of the unarmed Walter Scott 's death at the hands of Officer Michael Slager continues to reverberate . Aside from the incontrovertible evidence on the tape that the accused officer shot him in the back as if he were doing target practice , there has since emerged more tape of the traffic stop itself and audio of the officer speaking with his superiors on the phone raising even more questions about his state of mind at the time of the shooting . But as journalists have gone back and studied the officer 's record and found that he was previously investigated for taser abuse . And on even further investigation it was found that this jurisdiction is known as `` Taser town '' :\nUntil the eight shots heard ’ round the world , cops in North Charleston , South Carolina , were primarily distinguished by their zesty use of Tasers . As computed by a local newspaper in 2006 , cops there used Tasers 201 times in an 18-month period , averaging once every 40 hours in one six-month stretch and disproportionately upon African Americans . The Charleston Post & Courier did the tally after the death of a mentally ill man named Kip Black , who was tasered six times on one occasion and nine times on another . Black died immediately after the second jolting , though the coroner set the cause of death as cocaine-fueled “ excited delirium syndrome . ”\nIt 's important to note that Taser International has spent large sums convincing local coroners that this syndrome ( which primarily seems to kill people in police custody ) makes it the victim 's responsibility if they have the bad luck to die from being shot full of electricity with a taser . It 's not just illegal drugs in the system which can allegedly cause it . Adrenaline can as well . So if a person fails to remain calm in face of an arrest and finds the feeling of 50,000 volts going through their system to be stressful they have no one to blame but themselves if they die .\nThose who have been following the story of Walter Scott understand the significance of the taser . It 's not just that the officer evidently lied about Scott taking his taser , thus somehow justifying his using lethal force , or the fact that he appears to have tried to plant the taser next to the slain man 's body to cover his tracks . The man who filmed the shooting said this :\n“ I remember the police had control of the situation . He had control of Scott , and Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser . You can hear the sound of the Taser ... before I started recording . I believe he just wanted to get away from the Taser . ”\nIt 's not unusual for people to try to escape from a taser if they can . It is , quite literally , a torture device designed to force compliance with terrible pain . The people of Taser Town , particularly African American men , undoubtedly understand exactly what is going to happen if they find themselves in the custody of a police officer . Here 's one example of how it would likely go down , as reported by The Guardian :\nSlager is among three patrolmen named in a lawsuit filed by Julius Wilson , who said he was arrested after being stopped in his car in August last year . Wilson is also suing the city of North Charleston , the city police department and police chief Eddie Driggers . Speaking at a press conference on Monday , Wilson described Slager and his colleagues as “ bad , corrupt cops ” . He said : “ The use of excessive force or punishment to torture suspects is not something that should be tolerated by the North Charleston police department. ” [ ... ]\nWilson , who has a criminal record , said he was stopped on 25 August because his vehicle had a broken tail light . Scott , 50 , was stopped for the same reason on 5 April before fleeing and being shot dead by Slager . Wilson was stopped by an Officer Edwards , he said , who was joined 10 minutes later by Slager and an officer Clemens despite Wilson calmly “ making small talk and laughing ” . After refusing to step out until he was told why he was being arrested , Wilson claimed , he was forcibly pulled out of his vehicle by Slager and the two other officers . The three then “ forcibly restrained Wilson on his stomach on the pavement face down , ” the lawsuit stated . Despite Wilson “ not moving , nor resisting ” and lying with his hands above his head , the lawsuit claimed , Slager broke a silence among the officers by shouting : “ Watch out ! I ’ m going to tase ! ” He then allegedly “ shot his NCPD-issued taser into Wilson ’ s back ” . The lawsuit alleged Wilson “ writhed in pain from the electric shock ” . It said when Slager warned his colleagues he was about to fire his taser , “ Wilson was cooperating fully ” and allowing the two other officers to place his hands behind his back .\nTasers guidelines vary by department and jurisdiction , but generally their use is only considered reasonable when the subject poses a safety threat . Clearly , shooting an unarmed 50-year-old man when he runs from the taser is not one of those cases . The video of the Scott incident shows that Officer Slager is confused on that issue , to say the least . And it 's just as clear , based on that same standard , that nobody could ever claim such force is justified when presented with an unarmed suspect facing down on the ground , with his hands behind his back . Using a taser in that situation is simply a form of unofficial street justice , a little torture at the hands of the authorities to make a point . Tasers are not simply used in place of lethal force , and they 're not always used to force compliance . They are very often used as on-the-spot punishment by police who want to teach citizens a lesson .\nTake the now notorious California incident that happened to be filmed by a local news station , in which a man on horseback led police on a chase through the desert . When he fell from the horse , police swarmed and he very clearly laid down on his stomach and put his hands behind his back . Then the police beat the hell out of him and tasered him repeatedly . This footage has garnered widespread criticism because of the beating , and for good reason . It 's brutal , primitive behavior .\nBut you wo n't find many people expressing outrage about the electric shocks being administered to this man over and over again . Here 's a typical news report of the incident :\nIn video captured by cameras aboard a helicopter for KNBC , deputies gather around the man after he falls from a horse he was riding to flee from them . The video shows deputies using a stun gun on him and then repeatedly kicking and hitting him . KNBC reported that the man -- identified by authorities as Francis Pusok -- appeared to be kicked 17 times , punched 37 times and hit with a baton four times .\nAgain , if you look at the footage , Pusok was on the ground , face down with his hands behind his back before anyone tasered him or physically assaulted him . And yet the tasering is apparently considered a-ok. At the very least , it is n't mentioned as something that shocks the conscience the way the beating does.Perhaps this is because the searing pain of electro-shock does n't leave much in the way of a mark . But hideously painful it is . Yet for some reason , delivering this particular agony to a suspect is not something people reject when there is no danger to police or bystanders , and the suspect is compliant . But police do it routinely , and are rarely sanctioned for it .\nSome of this undoubtedly stems from the fact that popular culture has turned tasering into slapstick comedy . Movies and TV shows and countless Youtube videos portray it as a hilarious joke . `` Do n't tase me bro '' became as national catch phrase . But it 's not funny . Tasers can kill people . And regardless of what level of respect and compliance one thinks police are entitled to get from the public , they are not entitled to torture and punish citizens to teach them a lesson .\nWalter Scott ran from the pain of the taser and he was shot in the back numerous times for doing it . Francis Pusok was compliant and was tasered and beaten repeatedly anyway . It appears that such shootings and beatings , when captured on film anyway , are still considered beyond the pale in America these days . In both cases , officers will have to face some sanction for their behavior . Slager is facing a murder charge . It 's unknown what the California cops will face , but the FBI is investigating , so there may be some federal civil rights charges . It will be very interesting if any of the officers are charged with assault for using the taser . Let 's just say it will be among the vast minority of cases ever brought if they are .",

The video of the Scott incident shows that Officer Slager is confused on that issue, to say the least. And it's just as clear, based on that same standard, that nobody could ever claim such force is justified when presented with an unarmed suspect facing down on the ground, with his hands behind his back. Using a taser in that situation is simply a form of unofficial street justice, a little torture at the hands of the authorities to make a point. Tasers are not simply used in place of lethal force, and they're not always used to force compliance. They are very often used as on-the-spot punishment by police who want to teach citizens a lesson.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTake the now notorious California incident that happened to be filmed by a local news station, in which a man on horseback led police on a chase through the desert. When he fell from the horse, police swarmed and he very clearly laid down on his stomach and put his hands behind his back. Then the police beat the hell out of him and tasered him repeatedly. This footage has garnered widespread criticism because of the beating, and for good reason. It's brutal, primitive behavior.\n\nBut you won't find many people expressing outrage about the electric shocks being administered to this man over and over again. Here's a typical news report of the incident:\n\nIn video captured by cameras aboard a helicopter for KNBC, deputies gather around the man after he falls from a horse he was riding to flee from them. The video shows deputies using a stun gun on him and then repeatedly kicking and hitting him. KNBC reported that the man -- identified by authorities as Francis Pusok -- appeared to be kicked 17 times, punched 37 times and hit with a baton four times.\n\nAgain, if you look at the footage, Pusok was on the ground, face down with his hands behind his back before anyone tasered him or physically assaulted him. And yet the tasering is apparently considered a-ok. At the very least, it isn't mentioned as something that shocks the conscience the way the beating does.Perhaps this is because the searing pain of electro-shock doesn't leave much in the way of a mark. But hideously painful it is. Yet for some reason, delivering this particular agony to a suspect is not something people reject when there is no danger to police or bystanders, and the suspect is compliant. But police do it routinely, and are rarely sanctioned for it.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSome of this undoubtedly stems from the fact that popular culture has turned tasering into slapstick comedy. Movies and TV shows and countless Youtube videos portray it as a hilarious joke. \"Don't tase me bro\" became as national catch phrase. But it's not funny. Tasers can kill people. And regardless of what level of respect and compliance one thinks police are entitled to get from the public, they are not entitled to torture and punish citizens to teach them a lesson.\n\nWalter Scott ran from the pain of the taser and he was shot in the back numerous times for doing it. Francis Pusok was compliant and was tasered and beaten repeatedly anyway. It appears that such shootings and beatings, when captured on film anyway, are still considered beyond the pale in America these days. In both cases, officers will have to face some sanction for their behavior. Slager is facing a murder charge. It's unknown what the California cops will face, but the FBI is investigating, so there may be some federal civil rights charges. It will be very interesting if any of the officers are charged with assault for using the taser. Let's just say it will be among the vast minority of cases ever brought if they are.",

         "NEW YORK ( ███ ) - Support for U.S. President Donald Trump increased slightly among Republicans after he lashed out on Twitter over the weekend in a racially charged attack on four minority Democratic congresswomen , a ███/Ipsos public opinion poll shows .\nThe national survey , conducted on Monday and Tuesday after Trump told the lawmakers they should “ go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came , ” showed his net approval among members of his Republican Party rose by 5 percentage points to 72 % , compared with a similar poll that ran last week .\nTrump , who is seeking re-election next year , has lost support , however , with Democrats and independents since the Sunday tweetstorm .\nAmong independents , about three out of 10 said they approved of Trump , down from four out of 10 a week ago . His net approval - the percentage who approve minus the percentage who disapprove - dropped by 2 points among Democrats in the poll .\nTrump ’ s overall approval remained unchanged over the past week . According to the poll , 41 % of the U.S. public said they approved of his performance in office , while 55 % disapproved .\nThe results showed strong Republican backing for Trump as the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives passed a symbolic resolution on Tuesday , largely along party lines , to condemn him for “ racist comments ” against the four Democratic lawmakers .\nAll four U.S. representatives - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , Ilhan Omar of Minnesota , Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan - are U.S. citizens . Three were born in the United States .\nThe public response to Trump ’ s statements appeared to be a little better for him than in 2017 , after the president said there were “ very fine people ” on both sides of a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville , Virginia .\nIn that instance , Trump ’ s net approval dropped by about 10 points a week after the Charlottesville rally .\nThis time , while Democrats and some independents may see clear signs of racial intolerance woven throughout Trump ’ s tweets , Republicans are hearing a different message , said Vincent Hutchings , a political science and African-American studies professor at the University of Michigan .\n“ To Republicans , Trump is simply saying : ‘ Hey , if you don ’ t like America , you can leave , ” Hutchings said . “ That is not at all controversial . If you already support Trump , then it ’ s very easy to interpret his comments that way . ”\nBy criticizing liberal members of the House , Trump is “ doing exactly what Republicans want him to do , ” Hutchings said . “ He ’ s taking on groups that they oppose . ”\nThe ███/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English and gathered responses from 1,113 adults , including 478 Democrats and 406 Republicans in the United States . It has a credibility interval , a measure of precision , of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 points for Democrats or Republicans .",

According to the poll, 41% of the U.S. public said they approved of his performance in office, while 55% disapproved.\n\nThe results showed strong Republican backing for Trump as the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives passed a symbolic resolution on Tuesday, largely along party lines, to condemn him for “racist comments” against the four Democratic lawmakers.\n\nAll four U.S. representatives - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan - are U.S. citizens. Three were born in the United States.\n\nThe public response to Trump’s statements appeared to be a little better for him than in 2017, after the president said there were “very fine people” on both sides of a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nIn that instance, Trump’s net approval dropped by about 10 points a week after the Charlottesville rally.\n\nThis time, while Democrats and some independents may see clear signs of racial intolerance woven throughout Trump’s tweets, Republicans are hearing a different message, said Vincent Hutchings, a political science and African-American studies professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 16, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\n“To Republicans, Trump is simply saying: ‘Hey, if you don’t like America, you can leave,” Hutchings said. “That is not at all controversial. If you already support Trump, then it’s very easy to interpret his comments that way.”\n\nBy criticizing liberal members of the House, Trump is “doing exactly what Republicans want him to do,” Hutchings said. “He’s taking on groups that they oppose.”\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English and gathered responses from 1,113 adults, including 478 Democrats and 406 Republicans in the United States. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 points for Democrats or Republicans.",

         "Six bullets . More than I can count on one hand . That is how many times preliminary autopsy reports indicate that Michael Brown was shot . Nothing about the youthful infraction of strolling down the middle of a residential street in one ’ s own neighborhood justifies having your life ripped away from you by an irate officer firing six bullets as you face him , hands up in surrender .\nI can not even fathom what Mike , “ Big Mike ” as his friends call him , felt as each of those bullets entered his flesh . I do know a little of the rage , despair , helplessness and hopelessness that black communities have been left to feel in the aftermath of his death . I know he stayed conscious long enough to put his hands up , to try and surrender , as if to say , “ I want to live . Please don ’ t kill me . ”\nFerguson residents and protesters now find themselves arms outstretched , palms up , yelling “ don ’ t shoot , ” as police officers in guns , gas masks and tanks occupy the streets of Ferguson , Missouri , dropping canisters of tear gas on our American dreams . Those of us not yet there in Ferguson watch helplessly as the images of at least one child being tear-gassed come through our Twitter feeds , as journalists find themselves facing down the barrel of a hastily drawn police weapon or thrown in jail , as police drop stun grenades on crowds that refuse to comply with the unreasonable demand that they relinquish their right to peaceful assembly .\nWhile the world watches aghast , America ’ s penchant for exporting guns , tanks and destruction to other places in the name of law and order has shown up on our own doorsteps , in our backyards , with people pinned into parking lots and onto their porches . They are told they must stay where they are or risk being shot with rubber bullets or have their faces and lungs sting with the inhalation of tear gas .\nPublic space in Ferguson is awash in black tears , but it is the sirens that we hear wailing . The people would weep , but they are too busy running , ducking and taking cover from the angry sounds of a system that does not love them , does not care about their meager “ rights . ”\nMeanwhile , the government attempts to placate the people with optical sleights of hand . Capt . Ron Johnson , by all accounts a sincere and affable leader and head of the highway patrol , replaced the police chief late last week , with promises that he would not employ military tactics to police the citizens of Ferguson . On Thursday I breathed a bit easier as we watched him giving hugs to protesters , marching with the people , allowing black women of faith to lay hands on him and pray .\nThat peace was short-lived after the Ferguson police inflamed crowds by releasing irrelevant footage of a conflict that Michael Brown had at a local convenience store when he and his friend Dorian went to buy Cigarellos . Late that evening the crowds returned , only to be met by more tanks , more tear gas , more guns .\nBeyond shock , I continue to be appalled at the extensive lengths to which the police have gone to protect Officer Darren Wilson and his family from any public reproach or reprisal in Mike ’ s death . They delayed the release of his name in order to provide him enough time to leave town . They then released his name to coincide with video of the Cigarello incident , which they later admitted he knew nothing about when he stopped Mike . It is clear that the police are closing ranks , showing that they value the lives of their own more than the lives of citizens .\nWe are told repeatedly that police are worthy of our respect because they risk their lives each day to protect us . That is not the case for black people . When we encounter police , our lives are at risk while they protect themselves . I started to temper my statement by saying “ some police , ” but that gives the impression that I am speaking of the actions of a few rogue officers . The problem with this logic is that we now know that Ferguson law enforcement has a range of problems – disproportionate stops of black residents , disproportionately low numbers of black police ( three out of over 50 ) , and a history of antagonistic exchanges with the people of St. Louis County .\nWe have a problem of overzealous policing in this country . That problem is exacerbated by issues of race and gender , so that black men are perceived to be far more threatening than they actually are . And when black women encounter police , we are not given the protections generally afforded to white femininity . Our womanhood does not mitigate the threat of police force . This , then , is not about the actions of a rogue officer , but rather about the ideology of overpolicing that deputizes extrajudicial behavior as completely justified , as long as the life being taken or haphazardly handled is a black or brown life . Though the killing of Brown by Wilson seemingly fits a long historical script of the harassment of black people at the hands of white police officers , the reality is that overpolicing is an ideology that many police officers subscribe to regardless of color .\nThat ideology is rooted in a kind of anti-blackness that sees black bodies as a perpetual and mortal threat . Anti-black rhetoric has shown up not only from the Ferguson police but also ironically in the reporting and advocacy of everyone from CNN reporter Don Lemon to rapper Nelly , in their continued focus on issues like “ black-on-black crime ” and the necessity of keeping law and order . “ Don ’ t use your last option , first , ” Nelly told folks on St. Louis radio . There is little recognition that it is Darren Wilson who used his last option – lethal force — first . Moreover , the whole point of using tear gas and military vehicles in this small community is to force the residents into a realization that they have run out of options . Sadly , anti-black ideology can emerge even from people who are black or who otherwise love black people .\nI know Americans like to see themselves as a law and order people , but the few folks who have rioted and looted over the last few days , many of whom are reportedly not Ferguson residents , were stopped in their tracks by peaceful protesters . Even still their presence exposes an inconvenient truth . The killing of unarmed teenagers by police officers is lawlessness . It shows a lack of respect for the sanctity of life and the rule of law . The supreme irony is seeing folks defend the officer ’ s lawlessness while calling for people destroying property to respect the law .\nAs I keep saying , destruction of property is not particularly productive . But I refuse to direct my ire toward anyone but the officer who unjustly took Michael Brown ’ s life and the police establishment that is now complicit in this crime .\nI am tired . Emotionally exhausted , actually . I am tired of going to sleep each night seeing a community of people who look like me under military siege . I ’ m tired of seeing crying black mothers – Sybrina Fulton , Lucia McBath and Leslie McSpadden —distraught over the loss of their teenage sons Trayvon , Jordan and Michael . I ’ m tired of hearing report after report of people under attack from tear gas . I ’ m tired of journalists being bullied for trying to tell the truth . I ’ m tired of explaining to white people why our anger is justified , why looting , which is a property crime , should not even be part of a conversation about the killing of a teenager , why the alleged shoplifting of cigarettes is not a capital offense , why the police officer who killed Mike for the crime of walking in the street is the real thug .\nWhite racism and white privilege continue a bad cop-good cop routine with black America that is utterly exhausting . Just when we think we are making headway , a well-meaning white person asks “ but can ’ t we condemn the looting too ? ” The question is : Have you condemned the killing ? Or have you tried to explain it away ? To justify it ?\nI will not engage in a condemnation quid pro quo with trolls , well-meaning white citizens or respectable black ones , “ Brand New Negroes ” I call them , in the tradition of the famous text from Harlem Renaissance philosopher Alain Locke . I will not concede that destruction of property is equal to the taking of life . I will not answer calls to be reasonable in the face of unreasonable , unjustifiable black death . I will not believe the lie that black propriety and respectability – pulling our pants up , speaking corporate English , never , ever doing anything wrong – will save us .\nFerguson exposes the extent to which American necropolitics shapes the terms and conditions of black life in what professor Sundiata Cha-Jua calls a new racial nadir . The first racial nadir happened from about 1890 to about 1930 , when black people experienced the unprecedented loss of political gains hard won in the aftermath of the Civil War and the astronomical rise of lynching . We have indeed reached a new nadir in America ’ s racial life , one hard to fathom as a black president sits in the White House , abdicating his responsibility to speak forcefully and forthrightly to the problem of racism and military-style policing both for fear of being seen as too “ black ” and for fear of political reprisal from the right .\nMeanwhile , our voting rights have been stripped away , our kids are being killed in the streets , their killers rarely convicted , and our communities are placed under siege . And our black president reminds us that `` there are young black men who commit crime , '' though he feels no responsibility to say this about any other race of people . It 's a shaming tactic that suggests that black people do not have the right to be angry when our communities are beset with so many problems . It is the kind of anti-black thinking that suggests `` acting respectably '' will save us .\nThese are scary times . They are times for rage . Time for telling the truth . Time for ripping the band-aids off our gaping wounds . Time to recognize that we can neither heal nor fix that which we will not confront .",

Josh Hawley, for instance, introduced legislation in June seeking to prevent American researchers from using technologies developed by Chinese big tech companies.\n\nUniversities are “key targets of espionage and intellectual property theft by not only China, but Russia and Iran,” the Missouri Republican said in a statement announcing the bill. “For too long, these countries have sent students to our universities to collect sensitive research that they can later use to develop capabilities that threaten our national security.”\n\nHawley introduced a bill in May that would force President Donald Trump to restrict technology to China that would contribute to the country’s military. That bill would also place heavy restrictions on technology that influences artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and robots.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

         "In an extensive article published last month that included interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement officials , congressional officials and other government employees , the New York Times published a stinging indictment of James B. Comey ’ s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe .\nThe Times made the case that Comey violated FBI tradition , bypassed the Justice Department and went rogue on several occasions in a manner that clearly impacted the 2016 presidential election .\nIn a letter on Tuesday from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired , Rosenstein specifically cited Comey ’ s alleged mishandling of the Clinton email probe as justification for Comey ’ s removal from office .\n“ I can not defend the Director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of secretary Clinton ’ s emails , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ And I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken . Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes ; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives . ”\nRosenstein continued : “ The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General ’ s authority on July 5 , 2016 , and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution . It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement . At most , the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors . ”\nThat is precisely the case made by the Times ’ April 22 article , titled , “ Comey Tried to Shield the F.B.I . From Politics . Then He Shaped an Election . ”\nThe Times says that for its article it interviewed “ more than 30 current and former law enforcement , congressional and other government officials . ”\nThe newspaper concluded that Comey ’ s decision to inform Congress that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email probe less than two weeks before the presidential election “ violate [ ed ] the policies of an agency that does not reveal its investigations or do anything that may influence an election . ”\nThe article related that Comey decided to plunge the FBI “ into the molten center of a bitter election ” in part because he feared “ the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I . had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret . ”\nA significant motivating factor for Comey ’ s rogue approach toward the Clinton email probe , the Times revealed , was his distrust of senior officials at the Justice Department , especially then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch , whom , the newspaper reported , “ Mr . Comey believed had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation . ”\nIndeed , according to the Times , Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Hillary Clinton in the email probe .\nThe FBI had further information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence , leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the U.S. government ’ s Clinton email probe , the Times reported .\nIn his letter from Tuesday , Rosenstein argues that if Comey believed Lynch to be compromised he should have sought her recusal instead of taking matters into his own hands .\n“ The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Lynch had a conflict , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department . There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General . ”\nIndeed , according to the Times , after it became clear that the F.B.I . did not discover Clinton emails showing intent to mishandle classified information – the agency believed those emails were among the correspondence deleted by Clinton – Comey made the decision to bypass the Justice Department and explain the case to the public .\nNine months into the investigation , it became clear to Mr. Comey that Mrs. Clinton was almost certainly not going to face charges . He quietly began work on talking points , toying with the notion that in the midst of a bitter presidential campaign , a Justice Department led by Democrats may not have the credibility to close the case , and that he alone should explain that decision to the public .\nComey ’ s decision was further fueled by the alleged document written by a Democratic operative hacked by the Russians , a document that in Comey ’ s view raised “ questions about [ Lynch ’ s ] independence , ” the Times reported .\nInstead of seeking Lynch ’ s recusal , as Rosenstein would later outline as the proper course of action , Comey decided to go at it alone , take matters into his own hands and make his public pronouncements about Clinton ’ s email case without the Justice Department .\nThe Times cited former Justice officials as “ deeply skeptical ” of Comey ’ s alleged reasoning :\nFormer Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account . If Mr. Comey believed that Ms. Lynch were compromised , they say , why did he not seek her recusal ? Mr. Comey never raised this issue with Ms. Lynch or the deputy attorney general , Sally Q. Yates , former officials said .\nMr. Comey ’ s defenders regard this as one of the untold stories of the Clinton investigation , one they say helps explain his decision-making . But former Justice Department officials say the F.B.I . never uncovered evidence tying Ms. Lynch to the document ’ s author , and are convinced that Mr. Comey wanted an excuse to put himself in the spotlight .\nComey ’ s decision to go rogue was solidified , according to the Times ’ account , after Lynch ’ s infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton , the husband of the FBI ’ s main subject in a criminal probe , boarded the attorney general ’ s plane and reportedly stayed there for about twenty minutes .\nYet Comey still did not seek Lynch ’ s recusal . The Times article related that after the tarmac episode , Comey “ knew for sure that when there was something to say about the case , he alone would say it . ”\nAfterwards , Comey held the press conference at which he criticized Clinton ’ s private email server as “ extremely careless ” before finally stating that “ no charges are appropriate in this case . ”\nWith his pronouncements , Comey offered judgments and legal conclusions many argue are out of the purview of the FBI , which is charged with documenting the evidence and handing it over to the Justice Department .\nThe Times cited unnamed “ frustrated ” prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them .\nComey ’ s injection into the presidential race did not end there . Less than two weeks before the election , the FBI discovered a trove of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of long-time top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin . Some of the emails , according to reports , originated on Clinton ’ s old BlackBerry server that she used before setting up her private home server and some believe may have contained the deleted messages .\nComey ’ s decision centered on whether to follow FBI tradition and keep quiet about the reopening of the case , or inform Congress about the ongoing investigation , which , the Times related , “ everyone acknowledged would create a political furor . ”\nEventually , Comey decided to go rogue again and inform Congress .\nLynch was against the decision , the Times reported , and the Justice Department implored the FBI not to impact the presidential campaign in its final days .

         "Aymenn Al-Tamimi, Jeffrey Lord, Debra J. Saunders, Brian Mcnicoll, Roger Kaplan, Jared Whitley",
         "“ Trump has betrayed the Syrian Kurds ” — so goes a popular refrain regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the areas of northeast Syria held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) . The events that have followed — namely , a Turkish invasion of parts of SDF territory along the border and the deployment of Syrian government forces in some SDF areas — have been characterized as a strategic disaster for American interests , with some commentators even proclaiming the withdrawal as indicative of a U.S. imperial decline and U.S. disengagement from the Middle East .\nIn fact , much of this is overblown . For one thing , the U.S. still maintains extensive troop deployments elsewhere in the Middle East , and those are not being drawn down anytime soon . Insofar as many of the pundits , analysts , and policymakers condemning Trump consider the recent developments in Syria to be a disaster , they primarily have themselves to blame , however popular bashing Trump might be .\nIndeed , these critics of Trump did not learn the relevant lessons from December 2018 when the president ordered preparations for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria . They should have appreciated that Trump is ultimately the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces and that he had made his own preferences on Syria clear : namely , that after the military defeat of the Islamic State , U.S. forces should leave . As the president ’ s record on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal illustrates , he has generally been forthright and sincere in trying to fulfill his policy promises . When he told his advisers that he wanted to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria , he meant it . The message should have been clear : devise an orderly withdrawal plan .\nBut that is not what happened . Instead , efforts and attention were geared towards U.S. forces remaining indefinitely in Syria . The advocates for this “ stay indefinitely ” approach argued that the deployment as it existed was supposedly an example of a successful projection of U.S. leverage and influence with a relatively small number of troops . They claimed that U.S. presence was vital for political negotiations on Syria ’ s future and important for limiting Iranian influence and blocking its “ land route ” to the Mediterranean .\nIn reality , none of these assertions holds up but rather reflect dubious expansions of the original purpose of the U.S. mission in Syria : countering the Islamic State . At the same time , the “ stay indefinitely ” crowd tended to downplay the major problem regarding the U.S. partnership with the SDF : the issue of relations with Turkey , which considers ( with some justification ) the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , which has fought the Turkish state for decades .\nRegardless of what one thinks of Turkey ’ s approach towards the PKK , it is not a problem that can be treated as a minor irritant . Facts of geography mean that Turkey is located along the northern borders of the SDF ’ s territory . As such , Turkey could be the SDF ’ s main gateway to the outside world , rather than the small and limited capacity border crossing on the Tigris River that the SDF has maintained with the Iraqi Kurdistan region . Thus , for the interests of the SDF ’ s longterm economic prospects ( among other things ) , some kind of détente or resolution of the conflict between the PKK and Turkey would have been necessary so that the region could have much more open borders and engagement with the outside world .\nUnfortunately , though , policymakers and advisers did not take Turkey ’ s concerns and its threats of a military confrontation with the SDF seriously enough . Along with their desire to keep U.S. troops in Syria , many of them imagined that Turkey could somehow be appeased through half-baked measures : thus the previous attempts to deny SDF–PKK links , the failed schemes of joint U.S.–Turkish patrols in the Manbij area west of the Euphrates River , and then the joint northern border patrols and partial dismantling of SDF fortifications along the northern border with Turkey a little while before the recent Turkish incursion against the SDF .\nOthers argue that the U.S. simply needed to be adamant in saying no to a Turkish incursion and that the small U.S. troop presence could have deterred Turkey indefinitely . This view is implausible . A small foreign troop presence can function as a deterrent to another side ’ s attack , but it is not an absolute deterrent here . To understand why , consider events that occurred earlier this year on the other side of Syria .

         "“Trump has betrayed the Syrian Kurds” — so goes a popular refrain regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the areas of northeast Syria held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The events that have followed — namely, a Turkish invasion of parts of SDF territory along the border and the deployment of Syrian government forces in some SDF areas — have been characterized as a strategic disaster for American interests, with some commentators even proclaiming the withdrawal as indicative of a U.S. imperial decline and U.S. disengagement from the Middle East.\n\n\n\nIn fact, much of this is overblown. For one thing, the U.S. still maintains extensive troop deployments elsewhere in the Middle East, and those are not being drawn down anytime soon. Insofar as many of the pundits, analysts, and policymakers condemning Trump consider the recent developments in Syria to be a disaster, they primarily have themselves to blame, however popular bashing Trump might be.\n\nIndeed, these critics of Trump did not learn the relevant lessons from December 2018 when the president ordered preparations for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria. They should have appreciated that Trump is ultimately the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces and that he had made his own preferences on Syria clear: namely, that after the military defeat of the Islamic State, U.S. forces should leave. As the president’s record on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal illustrates, he has generally been forthright and sincere in trying to fulfill his policy promises. When he told his advisers that he wanted to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, he meant it. The message should have been clear: devise an orderly withdrawal plan.\n\nBut that is not what happened. Instead, efforts and attention were geared towards U.S. forces remaining indefinitely in Syria. The advocates for this “stay indefinitely” approach argued that the deployment as it existed was supposedly an example of a successful projection of U.S. leverage and influence with a relatively small number of troops. They claimed that U.S. presence was vital for political negotiations on Syria’s future and important for limiting Iranian influence and blocking its “land route” to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn reality, none of these assertions holds up but rather reflect dubious expansions of the original purpose of the U.S. mission in Syria: countering the Islamic State. At the same time, the “stay indefinitely” crowd tended to downplay the major problem regarding the U.S. partnership with the SDF: the issue of relations with Turkey, which considers (with some justification) the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought the Turkish state for decades.\n\nRegardless of what one thinks of Turkey’s approach towards the PKK, it is not a problem that can be treated as a minor irritant. Facts of geography mean that Turkey is located along the northern borders of the SDF’s territory. As such, Turkey could be the SDF’s main gateway to the outside world, rather than the small and limited capacity border crossing on the Tigris River that the SDF has maintained with the Iraqi Kurdistan region. Thus, for the interests of the SDF’s longterm economic prospects (among other things), some kind of détente or resolution of the conflict between the PKK and Turkey would have been necessary so that the region could have much more open borders and engagement with the outside world.\n\nUnfortunately, though, policymakers and advisers did not take Turkey’s concerns and its threats of a military confrontation with the SDF seriously enough. Along with their desire to keep U.S. troops in Syria, many of them imagined that Turkey could somehow be appeased through half-baked measures: thus the previous attempts to deny SDF–PKK links, the failed schemes of joint U.S.–Turkish patrols in the Manbij area west of the Euphrates River, and then the joint northern border patrols and partial dismantling of SDF fortifications along the northern border with Turkey a little while before the recent Turkish incursion against the SDF.\n\nOthers argue that the U.S. simply needed to be adamant in saying no to a Turkish incursion and that the small U.S. troop presence could have deterred Turkey indefinitely. This view is implausible. A small foreign troop presence can function as a deterrent to another side’s attack, but it is not an absolute deterrent here. To understand why, consider events that occurred earlier this year on the other side of Syria. In the northwest of Syria (specifically the city of Idlib and its environs), Turkey set up multiple small military outposts in the insurgent-held areas ostensibly as part of enforcing a “deescalation” scheme in coordination with Russia. In practice, the goal has been to block any further Syrian government offensives on the northwest and prevent further refugee flows into Turkey.\n\nWhile Russia has shown some understanding of Turkey’s concerns in this regard, it also wishes to assist the Syrian government in restoring its control over the area and will not tolerate the indefinite presence of designated “terrorist” groups harassing Syrian government and Russian positions. Russia thus gave Turkey time to clear a demilitarized buffer zone of the likes of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (a designated “terrorist” group). When that did not materialize and the insurgent harassments of Syrian government and Russian positions continued, the Syrian government and Russia launched a military campaign that retook important areas in south Idlib and north Hama. The Turkish military outposts did not do anything to stop the offensive (indeed, they could not do so), and in effect the Syrian government and Russia worked around one of the outposts in north Hama. A ceasefire then followed, but it should be clear that it will not last if Turkey cannot crack down on the groups that are designated as “terrorist.”\n\nThat episode should also have been a lesson for U.S. policymakers. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly said he would launch an incursion against the SDF to the east of the Euphrates River (where U.S. forces in Syria have primarily been stationed), and in 2018 Turkey had carried through with its threats to destroy the SDF enclave in the Afrin area, where the U.S. had no presence. What would have stopped Turkey from finding ways to work around U.S. positions as part of its incursion against the SDF east of the Euphrates River and essentially forcing the small U.S. garrisons — confronted by much larger Turkish forces and their Syrian insurgent proxies — to get out of the way?\n\nThus, Trump’s indication to Erdoğan that he wished to leave Syria and would not oppose an incursion likely hastened the Turkish operations against the SDF. But it was not the decisive factor in determining whether or not those operations would have eventually occurred anyway.

Takei, meanwhile, vowed to boycott the upcoming GenCon gaming convention in Indianapolis if Pence signed the legislation, and GenCon's CEO warned the governor that the legislation \"will factor into our decision-making on hosting the convention in the state of Indiana in future years.\"\n\nThe Disciples of Christ, a liberal denomination, joined the outcry, declaring that it would relocate its General Assembly, which was slated to be held in Indianapolis in 2017.\n\nThe legislation Pence signed bars states and localities from \"substantially burdening\" individuals' religious freedoms in the absence of a compelling government interest. Lawmakers throughout the country have proposed such \"religious liberty\" measures with the intent of allowing business owners and individuals to discriminate against LGBT people on religious grounds.\n\nLaws like Indiana's promise to serve as rallying cries for the religious right in the years to come, as conservatives grapple with the imminence of nationwide marriage equality and seek other ways to undermine legal protections for the LGBT community. Among the Republicans vouching for such measures is likely GOP presidential contender Jeb Bush, who told reporters in Atlanta last week that \"people have a right\" to \"act on their faith\" when it comes to providing services to LGBT individuals.\n\n(h/t TPM)",

         "Jim Acosta of CNN and other media personalities get exercised when the President calls Fake News the “ enemy of the people. ” President Trump does not call all news outlets or personalities by that term — only the Fake News . Certainly , that term is quite an incendiary sobriquet . The President reciprocates with it because he gets attacked with incendiary abuse . No American President in memory has been picked on and lied about with the intensity and frequency that President Trump has had to endure .\nThe media — because it is almost-monolithically Left-Democrat — regularly depicted Ronald Reagan as a moron , occasionally tying him to a movie in which he acted , Bedtime for Bonzo , where he went to bed in one scene alongside a chimpanzee . ( They forget that he was cast in the film as a university professor . ) Reagan endured it , avoided reciprocal name-calling , and history unequivocally has registered that he actually was quite brilliant , understood what so many others could not grasp , revived the moribund Jimmy Carter economy with creative strategies and tax-cutting boldness that George H.W . Bush myopically had called “ Voodoo Economics , ” stared down Mikhail Gorbachev and defeated a century of Communism , and launched an anti-ballistic military focus that his enemies mocked as “ Star Wars ” but that today is central to protecting Western democracies from incoming ballistic missiles . The “ Iron Dome ” missile-defense system that Israel has used so effectively against Gaza Hamas terrorist rockets is the fruit of “ Star Wars . ”\nThe Left Media almost universally depicted the brilliant Reagan as an idiot , and he somehow shrugged it off . Donald Trump is different because we do not manufacture our Presidents with interchangeable parts on an assembly line . It very well may be that the past week ’ s Pittsburgh terrorist attack , and the way the President responded , and the way the Left Media then hit the President viciously anyway is the “ Rosetta Stone ” — the small piece of archaeological evidence historians will need — to decipher that Donald Trump was right to call the Fake News Left Media the “ enemy of the people . ”\n1 . “ The People ” Benefit From a Robust and Independent Press — and a Fake News Regime Indeed Is the Enemy of the People\n“ The People ” indeed benefit from a robust “ press ” — more accurately called “ media ” in this digital age of televised news , digital internet-based news , and so much more than the mere newsprint “ press. ” If Stalin ’ s Soviet Russia had been covered by a robust media ( and if such media could have survived ) , “ The People ” would have learned that Stalin ’ s five-year economic plans disastrously were failing and were leading to mass starvation , moreover that he consciously was perpetrating genocide by starving millions of Ukrainians to death in the Golodomor , that he was putting millions of prisoners to work in tundra prisons to dig through ice manually to build canals and other infrastructure . An honest news media would have alerted the West , too , that Stalin was murdering millions . The New York Times had a sycophantically pro-Stalin liar , Walter Duranty , filing Fake News reports from the Soviet Union for more than ten years . The Times published the lies daily as “ news ” and made him their Moscow bureau chief for fourteen years . As a result , the West was lulled , cheated of the truth , made unaware of the evil . Yes , the Fake News indeed was the enemy of the people .\nLikewise , the New York Times— and the other mainstream media who took their lead from them — by and large refused to report on the unfolding Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews . Between 1939 and 1945 , the New York Times published more than 23,000 front-page stories . Of those , 11,500 were about World War II . Only twenty-six — in six years — were about the Holocaust . The Times was passively complicit .\nA robust newsmedia can save lives by exposing and revealing , while a Fake News regime can serve to assist in the despoiling of a people . When media foist false narratives to sow social discord , or when they assist tyranny with falsehoods , they indeed are the enemy of the people .\nSocial discord leads to streets being set on fire — witness Ferguson and Baltimore during the Obama Years . Social discord dispirits potentially valuable citizens who could help build a society , instead turning them against that society and motivating them to work towards its downfall or simply to drop out . In its worst aspect , social discord leads to armed insurrection and civil war . If the problem is that a Stalin is murdering millions by deliberately starving them while incarcerating millions others in slave camps in the Gulag , then insurrection and civil war can be righteous , potentially saving such a despoiled society . But when the society actually is doing quite well , when freedom reigns and people of all colors , creeds , religions , and ethnicities are enjoying remarkable opportunities to succeed and to live wonderfully rich and precious lives alongside their neighbors in respectful diversity , then Fake News media indeed are the enemy of the people when they seek to sow social discord in that welcome environment , aiming to up-end civil harmony .\nA maniacal dirtbag murdered eleven Jews in Pittsburgh . In time , perhaps after a decade or two of ACLU appeals , he will be electrocuted , injected , hanged , or hopefully all three . The dirtbag hated Jews , and he likewise hated President Trump . President Trump responded to the news immediately with profoundly sensitive and healing words aimed at condemning anti-Semitism and at comforting and consoling the Jewish community . Listen to his words . If the role of a President is to heal and unify , as President Reagan did after the Challenger tragedy , as President Bush did after 9-11 , then this President did so eloquently , sensitively . And then came the sowers of social discord to destroy the moment… .\nThe Left Media would not allow the President that moment to heal and unify . Instantly , they brought in one Left-Democrat anti-Trump “ analyst ” after another to blame Mr. Trump for the attack . They never blamed President Jimmy Carter ’ s anti-Jewish rhetoric for the 1977 Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue shooting in St. Louis . Nor Bill Clinton for the 1994 Brooklyn Bridge shootings of yeshiva students that included the murder of Ari Halberstam . Nor Clinton ’ s rhetoric for the 1999 Granada Hills Jewish Community Center shooting in Los Angeles . Nor Obama for the deadly 2009 Holocaust Museum shooting in Washington , D.C . Nor Obama for the 2014 Overland Park Jewish Community Center shootings in Kansas City that murdered three . But this time — with the same social dynamics as the others — they tried blaming the President . By sowing social discord with outright absolute falsehoods at a time that called for healing , the Left Media indeed were acting as enemy of the people .\nFacts are different from opinions . Facts can be discerned and evidenced . There is a reason that as many as 82 percent of Israeli Jews love President Trump , that more than 90 percent of American Orthodox Jews support President Trump . Likewise , a huge majority of British Jews — by more than three-to-one — support England ’ s conservative party and despise the Labour Socialists . Similarly , millions of Jews who have left the former Soviet Union hate Marxism and socialism , are solidly capitalist and conservative , indeed have changed the face of Israeli politics towards the more conservative Likud , now led by Benjamin Netanyahu . Throughout the world , Jews now vote conservative , are conservative — as reflected in our country , too , by American Orthodox Jews . The independent Pew Research Center has found that the Orthodox Jewish community will be the predominant Jewish community in a few decades , as the others disappear . Just as the voting patterns of the American Deep South have changed 180 degrees from Democrat to Republican in the century since the Civil War , so is the American Jewish metamorphosis now on pace to synchronize with every other Jewish community in the world that has moved towards conservatism . But Jews are not monolithic , as witness those in Hollywood and in certain media .\nSo look at what the Fake News Left Media did after President Trump healed and unified : They received a news release from a small , utterly insignificant , nothing of a Radical Leftist group , calling itself “ Bend the Arc , ” which said that they did not want the President of the United States to visit Pittsburgh . The thing is , those Radical Leftists do not want the President to visit anywhere . Just as there are rabid Leftist Catholics ( not to mention the more mainstream Leftist Nancy Pelosi , Joe Biden , and the Kennedys ) and rabid Leftist Protestants , these also are rabid Leftists . Within the normative mainstream American Jewish community , “ Bend the Arc ” is a joke , off the charts . Their CEO started off as a sex-club “ dancer. ” C ’ mon ! As reported : “ Cotler , who identifies as queer , recounted how a lesbian couple invited her to their [ event ] after she did a table dance for them at what she refers to as a ‘ sex club. ’ ” Feh !\nSo this Leftist fringe group issues their statement — and the Fake News Left Media then falsely report that “ the Jews of Pittsburgh ” ( not “ some Jews ” ) do not want the President to visit . Consider these headlines — and they are a mere sampling :\n“ ‘ You Are Not Welcome ’ : Jewish Community Leaders Do Not Want President Trump To Come To Pittsburgh ” ( Salon )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Stay Away Unless He Denounces White Nationalism ” ( NY Daily News )\n“ Trump ‘ Not Welcome ’ In Pittsburgh After Synagogue Shooting ” ( Al Jazeera )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Denounce White Nationalism ” ( Reuters )\nAll those stories thereupon cite the same insignificant radical-fringe “ Bend the Arc ” statement . Honestly — if there still is such a thing as honesty — that is outright Fake News . I know the American Jewish community . I have been a Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America , a congregational rabbi for decades , sat for six years during this past decade on the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America , have sat on committees of Jewish Federations and Boards of Hillels , have a whole lifetime résumé in this area . My rabbinical colleagues and I were bristling all day , reading and hearing this Fake News . The rabbi of the temple where the murders happened , Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers , explicitly welcomed a visit by the President . To report such lies , at a time of such intense passion , is to stoke flames among the populace . It is not unfair to call such liars “ Enemies of the People . ”\nThey do it similarly to convince Americans of Color that this President hates them . He beams so proudly that he has helped reduce poverty and unemployment in the African-American community . Likewise , in the Latino and Greater Hispanic communities . It is a hallmark of his every speech . How compare him to Hitler , for G-d ’ s sakes ? Why sow social discord between and among races when the President , despite his classical Trumpian gaffes , actually takes so much pride in his being a President for all Americans , in a country where — in his trademark line — “ we all bleed the same red , white , and blue ” ? Why denigrate his outreach to Black Americans , whether via Kanye West and Jim Brown or by speaking to a Young Black Leadership Summit ? Why begin narrating his Presidency on Day One by reporting falsely , as Zeke Miller of Time magazine did , the lie that he had removed a bust of the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office ? Why publish falsehoods to sow discord among the Black and Latino communities — if not to aim cynically to peel away their votes — by trying falsely to report that he is a bigot who hates them ? Here is a man who was in the public eye , in the world ’ s media center in the heart of Manhattan , with a weekly network television show , building skyscrapers and hotels , golf courses and casinos — all bearing his name — and no stain of racism or bigotry of such sort ever got attached to him through all those decades in the limelight . Why cause enmity and divide the nation , disillusion African Americans and Latinos from recognizing that this President seeks their advancement alongside that of everyone else ? Only to sow civil discord , to promote tension and unrest in the name of advancing an agenda that assures greater television ratings , higher advertising dollars , and a change in the elected government chosen of The People , by The People , and for The People .\n3 . The Proof the Pudding : Tagging the Most Pro-Jewish President in American History as an Anti-Semite .\nSo it comes back to the Rosetta Stone — the way the Left Media falsely portrays this President ’ s relationship with one demographic , the Jews , demonstrating a pattern of Left Media mendacity aimed at sowing social discord throughout . Even before he was elected President , the Left Media was calling him an anti-Semite by clutching at straws to prove the false narrative . Just as they did by propping up “ Bend the Arc ” into a Fake News depiction as “ Jewish Leaders , ” they regularly dig up the most irrelevant and unrepresentative people from the Far Left who are JINOs— Jews In Name Only — as “ experts ” on Trump and anti-Semitism . It does not end . These are lies , damned lies , and more damned lies being perpetuated by enemies of the people . Just consider these facts about the Trump Administration and the Jews :\nThis is an anti-Semite ? If so , may G-d smite us with an abundance of such anti-Semites ! Although his daughter , Ivanka , and son-in-law Jared Kushner are Orthodox Jews — as are their children , his grandchildren — that family connection in itself is not determinative . After all , we are told that George Soros is a Jew , and most every Jew I know would gladly trade Soros for two anti-Semites and a neo-Nazi to be named later . Soros is a major opponent of Israel and secretly funds organizations that oppose critical Israel policies . But the demonstrated life record of President Trump , a lifetime of working closely with Jews , amicably and warmly , makes him someone whom Jews throughout the world appreciate deeply . Again — every survey and poll of Jews who actually live the Jewish observances , the kosher laws , the Sabbath , the Torah demonstrates that he is warmly regarded in that community .\nThe Fake News about Trump and Jews is the Rosetta Stone . Once one cracks that hidden code , everything else becomes clear . The Left Media indeed propound Fake News , lies , and falsehoods . They undertake to stoke anger among African Americans , among Latinos , among women . The People rely on them for the news , the truth — and , yes , for honest reporting when the President is wrong because The People benefit when they are told the truth , even when the truth is not pretty . But to depict him as an agent of Putin , as a man perpetrating treason , a hater ?\nThese are the lies that come only from Enemies of the People .",

But Jews are not monolithic, as witness those in Hollywood and in certain media.\n\nSo look at what the Fake News Left Media did after President Trump healed and unified: They received a news release from a small, utterly insignificant, nothing of a Radical Leftist group, calling itself “Bend the Arc,” which said that they did not want the President of the United States to visit Pittsburgh. The thing is, those Radical Leftists do not want the President to visit anywhere. Just as there are rabid Leftist Catholics (not to mention the more mainstream Leftist Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, and the Kennedys) and rabid Leftist Protestants, these also are rabid Leftists. Within the normative mainstream American Jewish community, “Bend the Arc” is a joke, off the charts. Their CEO started off as a sex-club “dancer.” C’mon! As reported: “Cotler, who identifies as queer, recounted how a lesbian couple invited her to their [event] after she did a table dance for them at what she refers to as a ‘sex club.’” Feh!\n\nSo this Leftist fringe group issues their statement — and the Fake News Left Media then falsely report that “the Jews of Pittsburgh” (not “some Jews”) do not want the President to visit. Consider these headlines — and they are a mere sampling:\n\n“‘You Are Not Welcome’: Jewish Community Leaders Do Not Want President Trump To Come To Pittsburgh” (Salon)\n\n“Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Stay Away Unless He Denounces White Nationalism” (NY Daily News)\n\n“Trump ‘Not Welcome’ In Pittsburgh After Synagogue Shooting” (Al Jazeera)\n\n“Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Denounce White Nationalism” (Reuters)\n\nAll those stories thereupon cite the same insignificant radical-fringe “Bend the Arc” statement. Honestly — if there still is such a thing as honesty — that is outright Fake News. I know the American Jewish community. I have been a Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America, a congregational rabbi for decades, sat for six years during this past decade on the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America, have sat on committees of Jewish Federations and Boards of Hillels, have a whole lifetime résumé in this area. My rabbinical colleagues and I were bristling all day, reading and hearing this Fake News. The rabbi of the temple where the murders happened, Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers, explicitly welcomed a visit by the President. To report such lies, at a time of such intense passion, is to stoke flames among the populace. It is not unfair to call such liars “Enemies of the People.”\n\nThey do it similarly to convince Americans of Color that this President hates them. He beams so proudly that he has helped reduce poverty and unemployment in the African-American community. Likewise, in the Latino and Greater Hispanic communities. It is a hallmark of his every speech. How compare him to Hitler, for G-d’s sakes? Why sow social discord between and among races when the President, despite his classical Trumpian gaffes, actually takes so much pride in his being a President for all Americans, in a country where — in his trademark line — “we all bleed the same red, white, and blue”? Why denigrate his outreach to Black Americans, whether via Kanye West and Jim Brown or by speaking to a Young Black Leadership Summit? Why begin narrating his Presidency on Day One by reporting falsely, as Zeke Miller of Time magazine did, the lie that he had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office? Why publish falsehoods to sow discord among the Black and Latino communities — if not to aim cynically to peel away their votes — by trying falsely to report that he is a bigot who hates them? Here is a man who was in the public eye, in the world’s media center in the heart of Manhattan, with a weekly network television show, building skyscrapers and hotels, golf courses and casinos — all bearing his name — and no stain of racism or bigotry of such sort ever got attached to him through all those decades in the limelight. Why cause enmity and divide the nation, disillusion African Americans and Latinos from recognizing that this President seeks their advancement alongside that of everyone else? Only to sow civil discord, to promote tension and unrest in the name of advancing an agenda that assures greater television ratings, higher advertising dollars, and a change in the elected government chosen of The People, by The People, and for The People.\n\n3. The Proof the Pudding: Tagging the Most Pro-Jewish President in American History as an Anti-Semite.\n\nSo it comes back to the Rosetta Stone — the way the Left Media falsely portrays this President’s relationship with one demographic, the Jews, demonstrating a pattern of Left Media mendacity aimed at sowing social discord throughout. Even before he was elected President, the Left Media was calling him an anti-Semite by clutching at straws to prove the false narrative. Just as they did by propping up “Bend the Arc” into a Fake News depiction as “Jewish Leaders,” they regularly dig up the most irrelevant and unrepresentative people from the Far Left who are JINOs— Jews In Name Only — as “experts” on Trump and anti-Semitism. It does not end. These are lies, damned lies, and more damned lies being perpetuated by enemies of the people. Just consider these facts about the Trump Administration and the Jews:\n\nThis is an anti-Semite? If so, may G-d smite us with an abundance of such anti-Semites! Although his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner are Orthodox Jews — as are their children, his grandchildren — that family connection in itself is not determinative. After all, we are told that George Soros is a Jew, and most every Jew I know would gladly trade Soros for two anti-Semites and a neo-Nazi to be named later. Soros is a major opponent of Israel and secretly funds organizations that oppose critical Israel policies. But the demonstrated life record of President Trump, a lifetime of working closely with Jews, amicably and warmly, makes him someone whom Jews throughout the world appreciate deeply. Again — every survey and poll of Jews who actually live the Jewish observances, the kosher laws, the Sabbath, the Torah demonstrates that he is warmly regarded in that community.\n\nThe Fake News about Trump and Jews is the Rosetta Stone. Once one cracks that hidden code, everything else becomes clear. The Left Media indeed propound Fake News, lies, and falsehoods. They undertake to stoke anger among African Americans, among Latinos, among women. The People rely on them for the news, the truth — and, yes, for honest reporting when the President is wrong because The People benefit when they are told the truth, even when the truth is not pretty. But to depict him as an agent of Putin, as a man perpetrating treason, a hater?\n\nThese are the lies that come only from Enemies of the People.",

         "As he 's done the past couple of election cycles , the former President 's helping fellow Democrats . But this time around , his campaigning comes with the prospect of his wife making a second bid for the White House in 2016 .\nFirst stop for Clinton , who 's arguably his party 's biggest rock star on the campaign trail , was Tuesday in Louisville to help Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes , the Democratic challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell . The top Senate Republican is running this year for a sixth term .\nClinton has been a tireless campaigner in recent years , and he was the highest of high-profile surrogates for President Barack Obama in the 2012 election .

         "Last week , Creshuna Miles , Juror No . 8 in the Michael Dunn trial , gave an interview to CNN about the jury ’ s partial verdict . Although she believes that Michael Dunn is guilty of second-degree murder , a lesser charge for which the jury had the option to convict , she insisted that the case was “ not about race , ” that it never came up . Moreover , she believed Michael Dunn to be essentially “ a good guy , ” who made “ bad choices . ”\nStartlingly , she also indicated that until Dunn ran down the street chasing Jordan ’ s three friends , she actually believed that Dunn acted in self-defense .\nPost-racial thinking is insidious not only because it gives lie to the very real and continuing material consequences of racism in this country , but also because it seduces young , optimistic , idealistic black youth into identifying with the very systems and people who would kill them without a second thought -- and then go order a pizza and a take a nap .\nPart of what Miles ’ impressions of Dunn reveal is that the defense did a far better job of humanizing Dunn for the jury than the prosecution did of humanizing Jordan for the jury .\nBut her impressions also reveal a deep disidentification with the seemingly retrograde racial politics that informed Dunn ’ s fatal engagement with Jordan Davis . Those 20th century-style racial politics take as a given that a group of young black men listening to rap music must be up to no good and that white harm is imminent .\nSuch thinking seems not to fit the cosmopolitan , progressive 21st century narrative of multiracial acceptance that ideological post-racialism pretends to be .\nI know that jury selection is a strategy . And I know Creshuna Miles was picked because she is a black woman whose political views seem to be able to lay race to the side , even when it is so glaringly obvious .\nHad Jordan Davis been white , he would still be alive . Maybe Michael Dunn would have yelled at a white Jordan Davis for bumping rap music , but he absolutely would not have perceived such a kid to be a threat or the playing of rap music loud enough to constitute a capital offense .\nCreshuna Miles came to a right decision , and wanted to convict Michael Dunn of some form of murder . But her fervent belief that the case was “ about justice , ” not “ about race , ” misses a fundamental truth about American society . Justice and injustice in this country are inextricable from racial politics . Racial politics determine everything from who gets arrested to who gets convicted , the harshness of the sentences they ’ ll serve , and the quality of legal representation they ’ ll have .\nMoreover , Creshuna Miles is not just a black woman . She is a big , dark-skinned black woman , who rocks honey blond highlights in her hair . Her unmistakable , inescapable , culturally ethnic blackness is part of the unspoken but visual narrative of this trial . Just as Michael Dunn came upon a car and visually assessed threat based upon the color of the young men inside , the visuality of Creshuna Miles ’ body absolutely influences how her testimony is understood .\nIn some ways Miles is a perfect foil for Rachel Jeantel . In Jeantel ’ s post-Zimmerman trial interview , she discounted a juror who claimed race hadn ’ t mattered in the trial , telling Piers Morgan , “ Let ’ s be honest . It ’ s racial. ” In this case , Creshuna Miles , just one year older than and visually similar to Rachel , comes along and says just the opposite . In both cases , black America saw the bodies of these two women and cringed . Internalized self-hatred coupled with violent conditions for black men is always a dangerous brew for black women . So I have been less compelled to jump on the `` critique Creshuna '' bandwagon , because so much of it is rooted in the unreasonable expectations that we have for black women to know how to outwit a system that is designed to work against not just black men , but us , too . Still I see Rachel and Creshuna and a certain knowing emerges for me .\nI know that when you live your life in an unmistakably big black body , of the type that Rachel , Creshuna and I share , a body that is often seen as aggressive and threatening , two types of coping strategies emerge . One is a kind of aggressive embrace of one ’ s own blackness and a refusal to take any shit . That seems like how Rachel rolls . The other relies on a rejection of the truth about race as a form of triumph over the impenetrability of racial discourse . In other words , maybe Creshuna Miles felt more intelligent and progressive , by taking a contrarian position , by not holding the views that people assumed that she , as a black person , would hold .\nGiven her particular kind of black embodiment , Creshuna Miles ’ decision carries great weight in an American populace that deeply wants to believe in the myth of a colorblind system . The problem here – the lie of post-racialism , to be more precise – is that Miles ’ rejection of the racial elements of this case hold more weight precisely because she is a black woman . Essentially , finding the biggest and blackest of black women to say that there was no miscarriage of justice in this case helps assuage any white guilt .\nI ’ m not angry with Creshuna Miles . But I know her thinking , uninformed as it is , is dangerous . I know the justice system relies on the willing racial performativity of black people who are willing to discount the importance of race in matters such as these . Much like patriarchy requires the complicity and willing participation of women to continue , racism requires the complicity and willing , if unwitting , participation of black and people of color to continue .\nI ’ m deeply bothered by the fact that she does not seemingly understand the way in which her body was used against her . That she felt compelled as a black woman in the case to come out and insist on all the ways that it wasn ’ t about race suggests how deeply it is about race . Florida ’ s justice system pimped Creshuna Miles for her body type and flawed perspective . Her identification with Dunn is the flip side of the same kind of logic that got Trayvon and Jordan killed . She failed to recognize that she was on the jury and appealing to the media precisely because she reads as everything Dunn is not . She might see the justice system as colorblind , but it absolutely would not see her in the same ways . Everyone sees her color . By the same token , Trayvon , Jordan , Rachel and even Marcus Smart all believed they could engage white people who approached them combatively on equal or similar terms .\nWhen Zimmerman confronted and questioned Trayvon , Trayvon talked back and then fought back . When the Zimmerman defense team goaded Rachel Jeantel on the stand , she served up a healthy helping of visible disdain . When Michael Dunn confronted Jordan and his friends , they all verbally resisted his “ instruction ” and command that they turn down the music .\nThese young black folks have not fully reckoned with what it means to occupy a completely different social position than the white people who confronted them and demanded various forms of compliance . One set of social positions has legal protection and the right to armed self-defense . The other social position requires deference and the eschewing of all aggression in order to be believed and protected – and in order to stay among the living .\nJordan , Trayvon and Rachel never perfected the fine art of respectable resistance . And because I am deeply resistant to respectability politics on principle , I ’ m not sure they should . But the death and tragedy these young people have endured reminds me of why our ancestors frequently turned to respectable forms of resistance as a form of survival .\nWhen I look at Creshuna Miles , it is clear to me that her racial analysis is far more akin to that of her peers than different . All of these young people want to believe that they have the right to assert themselves and their rights and priorities in the same ways that white men retain the prerogative to do . Through the most brutal of lessons , they continue to learn differently .\nI hope Creshuna Miles learns differently . I remind myself that she is only 21 and that she did vote to convict . But racial innocence won ’ t serve her well . I hope she knows that she was chosen as a juror because of the combination of her black body and her whitewashed racial views , not despite them .

         "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on , though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question . So now , in order to preserve the broader framework — in which , for example , that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order , and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley .\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position , and the temporizing of others around her , I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done . There is still fierce opposition in some nearby quarters to what she has done , and she showed some degree of moral leadership when she called for state law to be quickly changed , so that the battle flag could be taken down . Yet , it ’ s equally clear that she has framed her argument well within the historical tradition of Southern white supremacist ideology — not in the heart of that tradition , to be sure , but still within the stifling folds of its garments .\nFor many people in our state the flag stands for traditions that are noble — traditions of history , of heritage , and of ancestry . The hate-filled murderer who massacred our brothers and sisters in Charleston has a sick and twisted view of the flag . In no way does he reflect the people in our state who respect and in many ways revere it . Those South Carolinians view the flag as a symbol of respect , integrity and duty . They also see it as a memorial , a way to honor ancestors who came to the service of their state during time of conflict . That is not hate . Nor is it racism .\nIn short , Dylann Roof messed things up for all the rest of us , so — unfortunately — things have to change . Implicitly , that ’ s the real bottom line . Haley continued , with a brief nod to the obvious , before hurrying on :\nAt the same time , for many others in South Carolina , the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past . As a state , we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints . We do not need to declare a winner and a loser here .\nAnd so she declared a truce — the truce of false equivalency — as the pathway forward :\nWe respect freedom of expression . And that for those who wish to show their respect for the flag on their private property , no one will stand in your way . But the statehouse is different . And the events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way .\nThe willingness to change is easy to grab onto and praise , but the more troubling aspects , the multiple ways in which change — not to mention simple justice — are more challenging to properly grasp , identify and name , much less come to terms with . At least three starting points can easily be identified , however . The first came from Ta-Nehisi Coates . Honing in on the underlying claim that Roof 's views did not reflect those of South Carolinians more broadly , Coates quickly weighed in to say :\nIf the governor meant that very few of the flag ’ s supporters believe in mass murder , she is surely right . But on the question of whose view of the Confederate Flag is more twisted , she is almost certainly wrong . Roof ’ s belief that black life had no purpose beyond subjugation is “ sick and twisted ” in the exact same manner as the beliefs of those who created the Confederate flag were “ sick and twisted. ” The Confederate flag is directly tied to the Confederate cause , and the Confederate cause was white supremacy .\nThis is the plain historical reality , and Coates goes on to rolls out stanza after stanza in an impressive historical litany of authoritative voices repeatedly underscoring the point , beginning with the Confederate states ’ own explanations for war , starting with South Carolina , then Mississippi ( which was particularly blunt : “ Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world. ” ) , Louisiana , Alabama ( “ the election of Mr. Lincoln can not be regarded otherwise than … an open declaration of war ” ) and Texas .\nHe then goes on to quote notable individuals , such as Jefferson Davis , not only affirming the centrality of slavery to the Southern cause , but elaborating on their desire to extend slaveholding into Cuba , Mexico and elsewhere , as well as propounding their belief that the equality of white men was founded on the slavery of blacks , and thus would be irrevocably lost if slavery were to be abolished . Thus , white supremacy for the South was not simply an isolated belief in the inherent superiority of whites as a race , it was the foundation for an aggressive and self-styled “ progressive ” worldview , a whole self-contained system of thought . The flag is inextricably linked to all of that .\nAs a second starting point it ’ s also true that the Confederate battle flag was largely a relic until it was revived in response to the Civil Rights Movement — first with Strom Thurmond ’ s “ States Rights Party ” in 1948 , then with Georgia adopting a version in protest of Brown v. Board of Education in 1956 , and South Carolina six years later — though , tellingly , the flag went up a year before the act authorizing it . For almost a hundred years , the South got on just fine celebrating its heritage without benefit of the flag . Indeed , the flag was raised over South Carolina as a result of the Civil War centennial celebration . This revival of interest in the flag was clearly all about renewed defiance of the federal government , which was finally being prodded into making good on the Civil War Amendments , and ensuring the full citizenship of African-Americans . Hence , today , the “ heritage ” the flag actually stands for is that of the 1960s , not the 1860s . Good luck with that .\nA third , related point , made by Jeet Heer at the New Republic , is that the flag matters tremendously as exertion of raw power . Its reintroduction in response to the Civil Rights movement sent a clear message : “ The feds might try to help you , but remember who is the boss down here . We still rule. ” Flying everywhere throughout the South , it sends the constant message to black Southerners , that they are not safe , they are not in control of their own personal security , much less anything else . Whatever other stories Southern whites might tell themselves and others about the flag , this basic fact remains . Indeed , the rhetorical act of denying the flag ’ s white supremacist meaning only demonstrates further how completely whites control things .\nBeyond these three starting points , there ’ s a vast terrain to explore , in terms of the white supremacist legacy the flag stands for and how it has reshaped itself over time . There are at least four key elements that any such account would have to explore . First , is the matter of white supremacy itself as a matter of organized social policy — both in terms of what it supports ( slavery in one era , segregation in the next , etc . ) and what it opposes ( abolition , integration , “ big government ” ) — as well as the culture it both depends upon and reproduces . Second , is the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to another , both establishing purportedly new foundations , while simultaneously reinterpreting the past .\nIt originally expressed itself in terms of slavery , then segregation and now largely in terms of what sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva described as “ colorblind racism ” in his book `` Racism Without Racists : Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America . '' Third , is the way in which white supremacy naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against . Bonilla-Silva ’ s book has a great deal to say about this as well . Furthermore , the pretense that the battle flag represents Civil War-era heritage rather than Civil Rights-era hatred is a telling example of how this process unfolds . Fourth , is the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance , etc . Haley leaned very heavily on this aspect of white supremacy in the process of pretending to reject it . So let us briefly consider each of these in turn .\nFirst , let ’ s reflect on white supremacy as a matter of organized social policy . There is nothing particularly difficult for people today to look back on past forms of white supremacy and reject them . It ’ s easy nowadays to see slavery or segregation as evil . Even Rand Paul , defending segregation in principle , said it was a bad business decision . But what about white supremacy policies today ?\nWhile part of the impetus to remove the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina came from respect for the Rev . Clementa Pinckney , the long-serving , highly respected member of the South Carolina State Senate , this only scratched the surface of Pinckney ’ s politics , as pointed out by North Carolina NAACP leader the Rev . William Barber on Democracy Now ! recently :\nReverend Pinckney , as a colleague in ministry , was not just opposed to the flag , he was opposed to the denial of Medicaid expansion , where now the majority of the state is opposing Medicaid expansion where six out of 10 black people live . He was opposed to voter suppression , voter ID in South Carolina . He was opposed to those who have celebrated the ending of the Voting Rights Act , or the gutting of Section 4 , which means South Carolina is no longer a preclearance state , and the very district that he served in is vulnerable right now . He was opposed to the lack of funding for public education . He wanted to see living wages raised .\nEvery item Barber mentioned is felt more deeply by the black community , so it ’ s not hard to grasp what a true rejection of white supremacy would look like . One might say that this calls for “ activist government , ” but the white South was all in favor of activist government `` When Affirmative Action Was White , '' as Ira Katznelson ’ s 2006 book explained . Thus , Barber continued :\nSo I would say to my colleagues , let ’ s take down the flag — to the governor — but also , let ’ s put together an omnibus bill in the name of the nine martyrs . And all of the things Reverend Pinckney was standing for , if we say we love him and his colleagues , let ’ s put all of those things in a one big omnibus bill and pass that and bring it to the funeral on Friday or Saturday , saying we will expand Medicaid to help not only black people , but poor white Southerners in South Carolina , because it ’ s not just the flag . Lee Atwater talked about the Southern strategy , where policy was used as a way to divide us . And if we want harmony , we have to talk about racism , not just in terms of symbol , but in the substance of policies . The flag went up to fight policies . If we ’ re going to bring it down , we ’ re also going to have to change policies , and particularly policies that create disparate impact on black , brown and poor white people .\nThe phrase “ disparate impact , ” which Barber used , is key to how white supremacy operates in the post-segregation era . It ’ s not that the races are treated entirely differently , only that the odds , burdens , privileges and benefits change , depending on the color of your skin . Often this happens without any conscious awareness , which is why Bonilla-Silva ’ s phrase , “ racism without racists ” is so apt . This is really not difficult to grasp — unless you ’ ve got a vested interest in not grasping it . In which case , welcome to the world of our second topic , the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to the next , and how\nTransitions between eras are often abrupt in some respects — the swift abolition of slavery in the final years of the Civil War , for example — while taking decades to work out in other ways . In order to first establish , and then fully stabilize the segregationist era , the meaning and purpose of the Civil War itself had to be reinterpreted through a white supremacist lens . The story of how that transpired over a fifty-year period is the subject of `` Race and Reunion : The Civil War in American Memory '' by David W. Blight . As I summarized in my review :\nBlight explains three broad visions of Civil War memory - reconciliationist , emancipationist and white supremacist . The first was born in wartime responses to its terrible brutality , epitomized by Walt Whitman 's experience of tending the wounded and dying of both sides . The second sprang not just from the war , but also from the Emancipation Proclamation and the more than 200,000 black combatants who joined the fight . The third gradually reformulated itself after the shock of military defeat , eventually dominating reconciliationist thinking by sacrificing racial reconciliation for the sake of sectional reunion .\nIt was not surprising that the reconciliationist view came to dominate — politically , materially , the nation needed sectional reintegration in a much more immediate way than it needed anything for its black citizens — a calculus that would eventually change over time . What ’ s striking is the relative ease with which the white supremacist vision came to merge with and dominate the reconciliationist view .\nThis is not the exception , but the rule in American history : any moves toward reconciling differences inevitably become infected with white supremacist aims — unless , of course , they are founded on them to begin with , as the case with American Colonization Society and the movement surrounding it , more on that below . A similar process has taken place with the end of segregation and the discrediting of overt racism which the norm in that era throughout the South , as well as in much of the North . This is essence of what Bonilla-Silva reveals in `` Racism Without Racists '' : a set of beliefs has emerged with superficially broad appeal , but which harbors a “ hidden ” white supremacist impact . Bonilla-Silva identifies four central frames at the core of colorblind racism : `` The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information , '' Bonilla-Silva writes . The first — and what I take to be the most significant and distinctive frame — is “ abstract liberalism , ” which he explains as follows :\nThe frame of abstract liberalism involves using ideas associated with political liberalism ( e.g . `` equal opportunity , '' the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy ) and economic liberalism ( e.g. , choice , individualism ) in an abstract manner to explain racial matters .\nWhat abstract liberalism hides is virtually everything having to do with history and indeed all social science , outside the narrow framework of market economics . It hides all historical inequalities , which recent research suggests persists for as long as ten generations . It also hides subconscious racial preferences , which can create intense segregation without any overt centralized coercion . But above all , it creates the illusion of some idealized social order , which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “ reverse racism. ” In short , the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them : they are the “ real racists , ” not whites !\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles , but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone . These are “ naturalization , ” which “ allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences , ” “ cultural racism ” which “ relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘ Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education ’ or ‘ blacks have too many babies ’ to explain the standing of minorities in society ” and “ minimization of racism ” which “ suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities ' life chances ( ‘ It 's better now than in the past ’ or ‘ There is discrimination , but there are plenty of jobs out there ’ ) . ” All three of these frames have been used in past eras . For example , Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past , so segregation was something blacks could and should accept . Similarly , cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism . But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today .\nAs I indicated above , not only does Bonilla-Silva ’ s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another , it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “ naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against. ” Indeed , this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “ common sense ” emerges , responding to multiple different needs at once , most typically , a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible , and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible . The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude , even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact . Meanwhile , those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order , even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics .\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic , the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance and so forth . It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else , and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done . Not only does white supremacy lay down the law , if conflicts arise in response , white supremacy takes the lead in naming , identifying and analyzing them , leading to proposed white supremacist solutions . On a macro scale , this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale , from the lowliest parts on up to the whole .\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society . It was originally founded to bring together two politically disparate groups , Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders , both united by the belief that free blacks faced a miserable future in America , and would be better off in Africa . This granddaddy of all “ grand bargains ” was laughable on its face — there hundreds of thousands of free blacks , far more than could ever be returned to Africa , even if they had all wanted to go — which most emphatically did not . But it was extremely popular with political elites , precisely because of its centrist power to “ bring people together ” — white people , that is . In his book , `` Of One Blood : Abolitionism and the Origins of Racial Equality , '' historian Paul Goodman had this to say :\nBy 1817 , African colonization had become more than a speculative idea . In the next decade , hundreds of prominent Americans -- political leaders including Presidents Madison and Monroe and religious leaders in most of the large denominations , from Presbyterian Lyman Beecher of Massachusetts to Episcopalian bishop William Mead of Virginia—threw their prestige and influence behind the America Colonization Society ( ACS ) , which established the colony of Liberia in West Africa . One of the most impressive voluntary societies of its day , the ACS boasted over two hundred state and local auxiliaries by 1830 . It was quietly assisted by President Monroe and endorsed by state legislatures and the major religious denominations , as well as by an illustrious panoply of notables .\nAs Goodman goes on to describe , the 19th-Century abolitionist movement was born out of free blacks ’ opposition to the ACS . It was precisely their unwillingness to be “ reasonable ” which formed the foundation of resistance which eventually spread to white abolitionists , and over a period five decades , eventually resulted in emancipation . Yet , almost up until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation he himself continued to be a supporter of colonization — such was the power of this “ centrist ” white supremacist vision . In fact , the ACS lived on for almost 100 years after Lincoln ’ s death — it only shut down in 1964 !\nThere are many other instances in which the cause of black freedom only advanced by refusing to be “ reasonable ” or to live up to some purported virtue or another . That ’ s because white supremacy , in one form or another , has always had such an enormous say in dictating what it meant to be “ reasonable ” or virtuous . And so it ’ s been incumbent on blacks to learn to think outside the box — to find a broader framework of understanding on which to found their moral as well as their political analysis .\nThis is why Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , once spoke to the American Psychological Association , and came out proudly for the cause of what he called “ creative maladjustment ” :\nI am sure that we will recognize that there are some things in our society , some things in our world , to which we should never be adjusted . There are some things concerning which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will . We must never adjust ourselves to racial discrimination and racial segregation . We must never adjust ourselves to religious bigotry . We must never adjust ourselves to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few . We must never adjust ourselves to the madness of militarism , and the self-defeating effects of physical violence… . Thus , it may well be that our world is in dire need of a new organization , The International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment .\nSimilarly , King ’ s “ Letter From Birmingham Jail ” was all about rejecting the framework of passive , superficial words of peace , moderation and restraint which the white ministers of Birmingham sought to impose on him . Here is just a small section of the wisdom it contains :\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress . I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace , in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight , to a substantive and positive peace , in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality . Actually , we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension . We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive . We bring it out in the open , where it can be seen and dealt with .\nI could not help myself thinking about the profound wrong-headed of “ reasonable ” white supremacy as I heard Nikki Haley ’ s speech , which is why my enthusiasm for it was so dimmed . In perhaps her most deeply typical move , she said there didn ’ t have to be winners and losers . Folks who love the flag and folks who despise it can all get along just fine ! But , of course , that leaves the entire substantive agenda Reverend Barber spoke about dead on arrival — just as it was supposed to do . There is no real underlying intent to address and disown the evil of white supremacy . The only way that evil is faced is by projecting it onto the disowned Confederate son , Dylann Roof .\nA good way to understand what ’ s wrong with Haley ’ s speech is to compare it with a speech by a quintessential white Southerner , Strom Thurmond ’ s son , whose speech makes no such attempt to defend the blind worship of “ heritage. ” Here is what South Carolina State Senator Paul Thurmond said :\nI am aware of my heritage . But my appreciation for the things that my forebearers accomplished to make my life better doesn ’ t mean that I must believe that they always made the right decisions and , for the life of me , I will never understand how anyone could fight a civil war based , in part , on the desire to continue the practice of slavery . Think about it for just a second . Our ancestors were literally fighting to continue to keep human beings as slaves and continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will . I am not proud of this heritage . These practices were inhumane and were wrong , wrong , wrong .\nWhere Haley felt the need to comfort — even identify with — those who see the flag as a symbol of noble heritage , Paul Thurmond simply said , “ I am not proud. ” Simple as that . A clean break . And that , my friends , is what America needs , where white supremacy is concerned . A clean break — and then the real business of a creating a livable future for all of us can begin .",
         "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on, though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question. So now, in order to preserve the broader framework — in which, for example, that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order, and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.\n\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position, and the temporizing of others around her, I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done. There is still fierce opposition in some nearby quarters to what she has done, and she showed some degree of moral leadership when she called for state law to be quickly changed, so that the battle flag could be taken down. Yet, it’s equally clear that she has framed her argument well within the historical tradition of Southern white supremacist ideology — not in the heart of that tradition, to be sure, but still within the stifling folds of its garments.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHere's Haley:\n\nFor many people in our state the flag stands for traditions that are noble — traditions of history, of heritage, and of ancestry. The hate-filled murderer who massacred our brothers and sisters in Charleston has a sick and twisted view of the flag. In no way does he reflect the people in our state who respect and in many ways revere it. Those South Carolinians view the flag as a symbol of respect, integrity and duty. They also see it as a memorial, a way to honor ancestors who came to the service of their state during time of conflict. That is not hate. Nor is it racism.\n\nIn short, Dylann Roof messed things up for all the rest of us, so — unfortunately — things have to change. Implicitly, that’s the real bottom line. Haley continued, with a brief nod to the obvious, before hurrying on:\n\nAt the same time, for many others in South Carolina, the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past. As a state, we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints. We do not need to declare a winner and a loser here.\n\nAnd so she declared a truce — the truce of false equivalency — as the pathway forward:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWe respect freedom of expression. And that for those who wish to show their respect for the flag on their private property, no one will stand in your way. But the statehouse is different. And the events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way.\n\nThe willingness to change is easy to grab onto and praise, but the more troubling aspects, the multiple ways in which change — not to mention simple justice — are more challenging to properly grasp, identify and name, much less come to terms with. At least three starting points can easily be identified, however. The first came from Ta-Nehisi Coates. Honing in on the underlying claim that Roof's views did not reflect those of South Carolinians more broadly, Coates quickly weighed in to say:\n\nIf the governor meant that very few of the flag’s supporters believe in mass murder, she is surely right. But on the question of whose view of the Confederate Flag is more twisted, she is almost certainly wrong. Roof’s belief that black life had no purpose beyond subjugation is “sick and twisted” in the exact same manner as the beliefs of those who created the Confederate flag were “sick and twisted.” The Confederate flag is directly tied to the Confederate cause, and the Confederate cause was white supremacy.\n\nThis is the plain historical reality, and Coates goes on to rolls out stanza after stanza in an impressive historical litany of authoritative voices repeatedly underscoring the point, beginning with the Confederate states’ own explanations for war, starting with South Carolina, then Mississippi (which was particularly blunt: “Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world.”), Louisiana, Alabama (“the election of Mr. Lincoln cannot be regarded otherwise than … an open declaration of war”) and Texas.\n\nHe then goes on to quote notable individuals, such as Jefferson Davis, not only affirming the centrality of slavery to the Southern cause, but elaborating on their desire to extend slaveholding into Cuba, Mexico and elsewhere, as well as propounding their belief that the equality of white men was founded on the slavery of blacks, and thus would be irrevocably lost if slavery were to be abolished. Thus, white supremacy for the South was not simply an isolated belief in the inherent superiority of whites as a race, it was the foundation for an aggressive and self-styled “progressive” worldview, a whole self-contained system of thought. The flag is inextricably linked to all of that.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAs a second starting point it’s also true that the Confederate battle flag was largely a relic until it was revived in response to the Civil Rights Movement — first with Strom Thurmond’s “States Rights Party” in 1948, then with Georgia adopting a version in protest of Brown v. Board of Education in 1956, and South Carolina six years later — though, tellingly, the flag went up a year before the act authorizing it. For almost a hundred years, the South got on just fine celebrating its heritage without benefit of the flag. Indeed, the flag was raised over South Carolina as a result of the Civil War centennial celebration. This revival of interest in the flag was clearly all about renewed defiance of the federal government, which was finally being prodded into making good on the Civil War Amendments, and ensuring the full citizenship of African-Americans. Hence, today, the “heritage” the flag actually stands for is that of the 1960s, not the 1860s.

But above all, it creates the illusion of some idealized social order, which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “reverse racism.” In short, the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them: they are the “real racists,” not whites!\n\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles, but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone. These are “naturalization,” which “allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences,” “cultural racism” which “relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education’ or ‘blacks have too many babies’ to explain the standing of minorities in society” and “minimization of racism” which “suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities' life chances (‘It's better now than in the past’ or ‘There is discrimination, but there are plenty of jobs out there’).” All three of these frames have been used in past eras. For example, Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past, so segregation was something blacks could and should accept. Similarly, cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism. But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today.\n\nAs I indicated above, not only does Bonilla-Silva’s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another, it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “naturalizes, normalizes and moralizes itself, so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify, much less name, and fight against.” Indeed, this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “common sense” emerges, responding to multiple different needs at once, most typically, a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible, and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible. The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude, even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact. Meanwhile, those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order, even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics.\n\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic, the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals, such bringing people together, establishing peace and harmony, promoting tolerance and so forth. It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else, and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done. Not only does white supremacy lay down the law, if conflicts arise in response, white supremacy takes the lead in naming, identifying and analyzing them, leading to proposed white supremacist solutions. On a macro scale, this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale, from the lowliest parts on up to the whole.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society. It was originally founded to bring together two politically disparate groups, Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders, both united by the belief that free blacks faced a miserable future in America, and would be better off in Africa. This granddaddy of all “grand bargains” was laughable on its face — there hundreds of thousands of free blacks, far more than could ever be returned to Africa, even if they had all wanted to go — which most emphatically did not. But it was extremely popular with political elites, precisely because of its centrist power to “bring people together” — white people, that is. In his book, \"Of One Blood: Abolitionism and the Origins of Racial Equality,\" historian Paul Goodman had this to say:\n\nBy 1817, African colonization had become more than a speculative idea. In the next decade, hundreds of prominent Americans--political leaders including Presidents Madison and Monroe and religious leaders in most of the large denominations, from Presbyterian Lyman Beecher of Massachusetts to Episcopalian bishop William Mead of Virginia—threw their prestige and influence behind the America Colonization Society (ACS), which established the colony of Liberia in West Africa. One of the most impressive voluntary societies of its day, the ACS boasted over two hundred state and local auxiliaries by 1830. It was quietly assisted by President Monroe and endorsed by state legislatures and the major religious denominations, as well as by an illustrious panoply of notables.\n\nAs Goodman goes on to describe, the 19th-Century abolitionist movement was born out of free blacks’ opposition to the ACS. It was precisely their unwillingness to be “reasonable” which formed the foundation of resistance which eventually spread to white abolitionists, and over a period five decades, eventually resulted in emancipation. Yet, almost up until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation he himself continued to be a supporter of colonization — such was the power of this “centrist” white supremacist vision. In fact, the ACS lived on for almost 100 years after Lincoln’s death — it only shut down in 1964!\n\nThere are many other instances in which the cause of black freedom only advanced by refusing to be “reasonable” or to live up to some purported virtue or another. That’s because white supremacy, in one form or another, has always had such an enormous say in dictating what it meant to be “reasonable” or virtuous. And so it’s been incumbent on blacks to learn to think outside the box — to find a broader framework of understanding on which to found their moral as well as their political analysis.\n\nThis is why Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once spoke to the American Psychological Association, and came out proudly for the cause of what he called “creative maladjustment”:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI am sure that we will recognize that there are some things in our society, some things in our world, to which we should never be adjusted. There are some things concerning which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will. We must never adjust ourselves to racial discrimination and racial segregation. We must never adjust ourselves to religious bigotry. We must never adjust ourselves to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. We must never adjust ourselves to the madness of militarism, and the self-defeating effects of physical violence…. Thus, it may well be that our world is in dire need of a new organization, The International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment.\n\nSimilarly, King’s “Letter From Birmingham Jail” was all about rejecting the framework of passive, superficial words of peace, moderation and restraint which the white ministers of Birmingham sought to impose on him. Here is just a small section of the wisdom it contains:\n\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with.\n\nI could not help myself thinking about the profound wrong-headed of “reasonable” white supremacy as I heard Nikki Haley’s speech, which is why my enthusiasm for it was so dimmed. In perhaps her most deeply typical move, she said there didn’t have to be winners and losers. Folks who love the flag and folks who despise it can all get along just fine! But, of course, that leaves the entire substantive agenda Reverend Barber spoke about dead on arrival — just as it was supposed to do. There is no real underlying intent to address and disown the evil of white supremacy. The only way that evil is faced is by projecting it onto the disowned Confederate son, Dylann Roof.\n\nA good way to understand what’s wrong with Haley’s speech is to compare it with a speech by a quintessential white Southerner, Strom Thurmond’s son, whose speech makes no such attempt to defend the blind worship of “heritage.” Here is what South Carolina State Senator Paul Thurmond said:\n\nI am aware of my heritage. But my appreciation for the things that my forebearers accomplished to make my life better doesn’t mean that I must believe that they always made the right decisions and, for the life of me, I will never understand how anyone could fight a civil war based, in part, on the desire to continue the practice of slavery. Think about it for just a second. Our ancestors were literally fighting to continue to keep human beings as slaves and continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will. I am not proud of this heritage. These practices were inhumane and were wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\nWhere Haley felt the need to comfort — even identify with — those who see the flag as a symbol of noble heritage, Paul Thurmond simply said, “I am not proud.” Simple as that. A clean break. And that, my friends, is what America needs, where white supremacy is concerned. A clean break — and then the real business of a creating a livable future for all of us can begin.",

We're actually going to claim less spending reductions because we're going to claim the real spending reductions, not the fake spending reductions.\"",

Small businesses , who get government relief money are expected to rehire workers , are unsure when the business will reopen and how it will operate . ( AP Photo/Charles Krupa )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — Some small businesses that obtained a highly-coveted government loan say they won ’ t be able to use it to bring all their laid-off workers back , even though that is what the program was designed to do .\nThe Paycheck Protection Program promises a business owner loan forgiveness if they retain or rehire all the workers they had in late February . But owners say the equation isn ’ t so simple , in part because of current economic conditions and partly due to the terms of the loans .\nAs a result , the lending may not reduce unemployment as much as the Trump administration and Congress hope .\nThe government ’ s $ 2 trillion relief package included $ 349 billion for the small business loan program , which was besieged with applications and ran out of money Thursday . Congress and the White House reached a deal Tuesday that would provide another $ 310 billion .\nTo get the loans forgiven , companies need to spend 75 % on payroll within eight weeks of receiving the money . The other 25 % can be spent on rent , utilities , and mortgage payments . Otherwise , the loan has generous terms : Only a 1 % interest rate and six months before any principal is due .\nMany of the small companies that were able to obtain a loan are having second thoughts about rehiring all their workers and a few plan to return the money . Others will use what they can on rent and utilities , and will use some to rehire a portion of their laid-off staff . But most are unsure they will be able to reopen eight weeks from now . They see little point in rehiring all their workers , paying them to do little or nothing , and then potentially laying them off again if business remains weak two months from now .\n“ You ’ re turning the business into a pass through for the federal government , ” said Joe Walsh , who owns Clean Green Maine , a cleaning service in Portland , Maine with 35 employees . “ You ’ re doing very little to actually help the business . ”\nIt ’ s unclear how much the small business lending program can hold back the surge in joblessness — a record 22 million people sought unemployment aid in the past month . Most economists forecast the unemployment rate will reach between 15 % and 20 % when the monthly jobs report is released in early May .\nMore money is clearly needed : Roughly 1.6 million small companies were able to obtain loans , the Small Business Administration said , out of at least 6 million that were likely eligible , according to Census data . Bank of America economists estimate that another $ 650 billion would be necessary to meet demand .\nAlso , the generous unemployment aid that was also included in the government ’ s relief package has made it more difficult to rehire . Many workers are making more with unemployment checks , which now include a $ 600 weekly benefit from the federal government .\nWalsh , who received a $ 280,000 loan from the SBA , said that he is reluctant to push his employees to return to work because , under unemployment benefit rules , they could lose their weekly checks if they turn down potential jobs .\n“ That ’ s just putting me as the employer in a really difficult position , ” Walsh said . He pays at least $ 17 an hour , with benefits , but his former employees are getting the equivalent of roughly $ 25 an hour from unemployment .\nRight now , Walsh ’ s business is closed due to lack of demand for cleaning services . He hopes to reopen soon and bring back some workers , retrain them on new sanitizing processes , and earn a bit of revenue . Still , he doubts his business will be anywhere close to what it was anytime soon , which means his workforce won ’ t be either .\n“ There ’ s no way that I ’ m getting to 100 % employment by the end of 8 weeks , ” he said .\nThe National Federation for Independent Business , a small business advocacy group , is pushing the government to make it easier for loans to be forgiven .\nThe group wants the SBA to eliminate the requirement that 75 % be spent on payroll , or at least reduce it to 50 % . It also wants the rehiring window extended beyond eight weeks and is pushing for a “ good faith ” provision that would credit companies for trying to rehire workers who prefer unemployment aid instead .\nThe NFIB also asked that half the next round of funding be reserved for businesses with fewer than 20 employees , to counter complaints that many large , publicly-traded companies obtained loans in the first round . The agreement reached late Tuesday did not make that change but directed some funds to smaller banks .\nAccording to a survey of its members , the NFIB said that just half of those who have applied for loans expect that they will rehire all their workers and get the entire amount forgiven .

Small businesses, who get government relief money are expected to rehire workers, are unsure when the business will reopen and how it will operate. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Some small businesses that obtained a highly-coveted government loan say they won’t be able to use it to bring all their laid-off workers back, even though that is what the program was designed to do.\n\nThe Paycheck Protection Program promises a business owner loan forgiveness if they retain or rehire all the workers they had in late February. But owners say the equation isn’t so simple, in part because of current economic conditions and partly due to the terms of the loans.\n\nAs a result, the lending may not reduce unemployment as much as the Trump administration and Congress hope.\n\nThe government’s $2 trillion relief package included $349 billion for the small business loan program, which was besieged with applications and ran out of money Thursday . Congress and the White House reached a deal Tuesday that would provide another $310 billion.\n\nTo get the loans forgiven, companies need to spend 75% on payroll within eight weeks of receiving the money. The other 25% can be spent on rent, utilities, and mortgage payments. Otherwise, the loan has generous terms: Only a 1% interest rate and six months before any principal is due.\n\nMany of the small companies that were able to obtain a loan are having second thoughts about rehiring all their workers and a few plan to return the money. Others will use what they can on rent and utilities, and will use some to rehire a portion of their laid-off staff. But most are unsure they will be able to reopen eight weeks from now. They see little point in rehiring all their workers, paying them to do little or nothing, and then potentially laying them off again if business remains weak two months from now.\n\n“You’re turning the business into a pass through for the federal government,” said Joe Walsh, who owns Clean Green Maine, a cleaning service in Portland, Maine with 35 employees. “You’re doing very little to actually help the business.”\n\nIt’s unclear how much the small business lending program can hold back the surge in joblessness — a record 22 million people sought unemployment aid in the past month. Most economists forecast the unemployment rate will reach between 15% and 20% when the monthly jobs report is released in early May.\n\nMore money is clearly needed: Roughly 1.6 million small companies were able to obtain loans, the Small Business Administration said, out of at least 6 million that were likely eligible, according to Census data. Bank of America economists estimate that another $650 billion would be necessary to meet demand.\n\nAlso, the generous unemployment aid that was also included in the government’s relief package has made it more difficult to rehire. Many workers are making more with unemployment checks, which now include a $600 weekly benefit from the federal government.\n\nWalsh, who received a $280,000 loan from the SBA, said that he is reluctant to push his employees to return to work because, under unemployment benefit rules, they could lose their weekly checks if they turn down potential jobs.\n\n“That’s just putting me as the employer in a really difficult position,” Walsh said. He pays at least $17 an hour, with benefits, but his former employees are getting the equivalent of roughly $25 an hour from unemployment.\n\nRight now, Walsh’s business is closed due to lack of demand for cleaning services. He hopes to reopen soon and bring back some workers, retrain them on new sanitizing processes, and earn a bit of revenue. Still, he doubts his business will be anywhere close to what it was anytime soon, which means his workforce won’t be either.\n\n“There’s no way that I’m getting to 100% employment by the end of 8 weeks,” he said.\n\nThe National Federation for Independent Business, a small business advocacy group, is pushing the government to make it easier for loans to be forgiven.\n\nThe group wants the SBA to eliminate the requirement that 75% be spent on payroll, or at least reduce it to 50%. It also wants the rehiring window extended beyond eight weeks and is pushing for a “good faith” provision that would credit companies for trying to rehire workers who prefer unemployment aid instead.\n\nThe NFIB also asked that half the next round of funding be reserved for businesses with fewer than 20 employees, to counter complaints that many large, publicly-traded companies obtained loans in the first round. The agreement reached late Tuesday did not make that change but directed some funds to smaller banks.\n\nAccording to a survey of its members, the NFIB said that just half of those who have applied for loans expect that they will rehire all their workers and get the entire amount forgiven. A quarter expect that at least three-quarters of the loan will be forgiven, while 15% didn’t know.\n\nThe American Sustainable Business Council and several other small business groups are pushing to have the starting date for rehiring shifted from the date a company received a loan to the date it can legally reopen. Many restaurants, gyms, and movie theaters have been shut down by the state.\n\nAdam Rammel received a $160,000 loan for his restaurant and bar in Bellefontaine, Ohio, near Columbus, though he’s uncertain about how many of his 17 laid-off staffers he will be able to rehire and when.

A federal judge has held DeVos in contempt of court for violating an order to stop collecting loans from thousands of former for-profit college students . ( AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was held in contempt of court after a federal judge said she violated an earlier order to stop collecting loans from former students of a defunct for-profit college chain .\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim issued the ruling Thursday in San Francisco , saying DeVos and the department made “ only minimal efforts ” to comply with a 2018 court order . Kim also fined the Education Department $ 100,000 and required the agency to make monthly reports to prove it is complying with the order .\nThe dispute stems from a lawsuit filed by thousands of former Corinthian Colleges students who say they were defrauded by the chain before it collapsed in 2015 . The suit says the students are owed full forgiveness of their federal student loans under a rule created by the Obama administration , and it challenges DeVos ’ 2017 decision to provide only partial relief based on borrowers ’ incomes .\nIn a May 2018 decision , Kim ruled that the partial-relief formula was unlawful .

A federal judge has held DeVos in contempt of court for violating an order to stop collecting loans from thousands of former for-profit college students. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was held in contempt of court after a federal judge said she violated an earlier order to stop collecting loans from former students of a defunct for-profit college chain.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim issued the ruling Thursday in San Francisco, saying DeVos and the department made “only minimal efforts” to comply with a 2018 court order. Kim also fined the Education Department $100,000 and required the agency to make monthly reports to prove it is complying with the order.\n\nThe dispute stems from a lawsuit filed by thousands of former Corinthian Colleges students who say they were defrauded by the chain before it collapsed in 2015. The suit says the students are owed full forgiveness of their federal student loans under a rule created by the Obama administration, and it challenges DeVos’ 2017 decision to provide only partial relief based on borrowers’ incomes.\n\nIn a May 2018 decision, Kim ruled that the partial-relief formula was unlawful. She ordered the department to stop using the formula and to stop collecting student loans from former Corinthian students.\n\nBut in a September court filing, the department acknowledged that it incorrectly sent loan bills to more than 16,000 former Corinthian students, prompting more than 3,000 to send payments. The department also garnished wages or tax refunds from 1,800 borrowers and provided credit agencies with negative reports about 800 borrowers.\n\nThe judge wrote that there was “no question” the department and DeVos violated the May 2018 injunction. She said the defendants had “not provided evidence that they were unable to comply with the preliminary injunction, and the evidence shows only minimal efforts to comply with the preliminary injunction.”\n\nThe Education Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLawyers for the former Corinthian students called the ruling a “rare and powerful action” that provides consequences for the “extreme harm” DeVos caused.\n\nDeVos “repeatedly and brazenly violated the law to collect for-profit college students’ debts and deny their rights, and today she has been held accountable,” said Toby Merrill, director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending, which helped file the suit. “The judge is sending a loud and clear message: Students have rights under the law, and DeVos’ illegal and reckless violation of their rights will not be tolerated.”\n\nIn her ruling, the judge said the department sent just a single, three-sentence email with instructions to loan servicers, along with an “equally cursory” email to certain borrowers. There were no meetings or phone calls, Kim wrote, and little effort to make sure loan servicers received the emails.\n\nThe judge threatened to impose further sanctions if the department fails to follow her order, saying she would appoint a court official to serve as “special master” to help enforce the injunction.\n\nThe $100,000 fine will repay students for expenses they incurred to raise the issue to the court.

         "I can not wait to learn more about the identity and motives of the secret whistleblower who figures so prominently in stories of Trump ’ s phone call with the newly elected Ukrainian president . The narrative that began a month ago , as an insider ’ s accusation of Trump ’ s threat to cut off U.S. military aid unless investigations were launched into his expected opponent Joe Biden , has evolved considerably .\nIt now appears — in spite of initial denials — that the whistleblower consulted with House Intelligence Committee ( HIC ) staff before filing his complaint — and was advised immediately to obtain counsel . Somehow , the chosen counsel was part of a whistleblower search organization , whose staff had previously worked with HIC chairman Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) . While the whistleblower ’ s complaint was based entirely on secondhand hearsay — which was explicitly precluded under existing reporting rules — those rules were changed after the complaint ’ s receipt so as to do away with the requirement of firsthand knowledge .\nWhat began as an admission that the whistleblower worked for the CIA and was a registered Democrat was accompanied by the absolute assurance that he was not an active partisan and had not worked in any current presidential campaign . That assurance now seems to be evolving into a situation in which the whistleblower had been assigned to the National Security Council , where he worked with former Vice President Biden — and may even have traveled with him on one or more trips to Ukraine .\nWords are being chosen quite carefully , and the truth seems more and more elusive , as Republican HIC members continue to be kept in the dark . One is reminded of Lewis Carroll ’ s Alice in Wonderland , in which Alice exclaims , “ Curiouser and curiouser ! ”\nWhile the mainstream media continues to provide breathless coverage as events unfold , they evidence a strong disinclination to ferret out more information regarding the whistleblower ’ s actual identity or motives in coming forward — almost relishing the idea that HIC hearings can feature his testimony ( whether he is actually present or not ) without his identity ever becoming known .\nThe obvious parallel is to “ Deep Throat , ” Woodward and Bernstein ’ s alleged secret source for many of their Watergate revelations , whose identity remained not only secret but also an integral part of Georgetown cocktail conversation for the next 30 years .\nFor those not living through the halcyon days of Watergate , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein became famous for their series of revelations regarding the status of prosecutors ’ ongoing Watergate investigations , but it was not until their 1974 book , All the President ’ s Men , that they credited a secret source they claimed to have referred to as “ Deep Throat , ” after a popular pornographic movie character . The more recent backstory is that their publisher at Simon & Schuster had encouraged them to add more drama to their proposed book , which is how the term first came into being . In short , Deep Throat was not a term used in print or even newsroom discussions before it first appeared in their book — as their calculatedly mysterious source .\nRegardless , speculation about just who Deep Throat might be was a dominant feature of Washington gossip for the ensuing decades . Possible candidates were inevitably confined to those who had served on President Nixon ’ s White House staff , including his Chief of Staff Alexander Haig , one of his many lawyers ( John Dean , Fred Fielding , Len Garment , or Fred Buzhardt ) , one of his speechwriters ( Bill Safire , David Gergen , or Ben Stein ) , or one of other young White House aides ( including Diane Sawyer , Jonathan Rose , or Jeff Donfeld ) . Even Henry Kissinger ’ s name occasionally surfaced in the unending speculation .\nThe common theme was that Deep Throat had become so disgusted with Nixon ’ s conduct that the need to reveal the wrongdoing far outweighed any idea of loyalty to the president . This was in spite of the fact that my boss and Nixon ’ s lead Watergate defense counsel thought at the time that the leaks were coming from Mark Felt at the FBI . This belief was accompanied by the recognition that we weren ’ t in a position to do much about it , since pressuring Felt might result in even more leaks . In fact , there is a humorous conversation on the White House tapes in which Haig suggests to Nixon that Felt is the one doing the leaking — and characterizes him as “ the white rat. ” Haig goes on to explain that ’ s what Felt is called behind his back at the Bureau : He has a long face and a rather sallow complexion . “ Well , Mr. President , he looks like a rat , ” is how Haig finally sums it up .\nFor decades afterwards , when I would mention that I had worked on Nixon ’ s White House staff , people would inevitably ask if I knew who Deep Throat was . When I answered in the affirmative , they would get all excited — until I said it was Mark Felt , the white rat . Then , since this obviously was not some famous name from Nixon ’ s own White House , their interest would wane and the conversation would move on .\nWhen Felt ’ s daughter claimed he was Deep Throat in 2005 and Woodward and Bernstein rushed out a book , The Secret Man : The Story of Watergate ’ s Deep Throat , supposedly confirming it , everyone accepted it at face value . For his part , Felt was way too senile to provide any real confirmation . More significantly , it turned out that Felt had no animosity toward President Nixon ; his leaks were designed to show that Acting FBI Director Patrick Gray couldn ’ t control the FBI and should be replaced by then–Deputy Director Felt .\nWhy , then , had all of the media been so certain for the prior three decades that Deep Throat simply had to be a disillusioned Nixon White House staffer ? Following Felt ’ s 2005 outing , I went back and re-read All the President ’ s Men and then compared the book to the subsequent movie version — only to discover tantalizing differences in Deep Throat ’ s treatment .\nIn their book , there is no implication whatsoever that Deep Throat is a White House employee . The authors were very careful not to give any hint at all as to his place of employment . The movie version , however , differs considerably — with implied White House employment occurring in three separate scenes : First , relatively early on , Woodward ( played by Robert Redford ) and Bernstein ( played by Dustin Hoffman ) are shown on the Library of Congress steps , lamenting that they are out of leads . Redford offers up the idea that he has a contact at the Nixon White House — and their paucity of leads quickly evaporates . Second , at one point , Redford calls Deep Throat ( played by Hal Holbrook ) at work . In the movie scene , Redford is shown in a public phone booth ( remember those ? ) located on the sidewalk across the street from the Old Executive Office Building — an integral part of the White House compound — which he stares at while speaking to Holbrook , who instructs him never again to call him at work . Third , when Holbrook departs from his office on his way to deliver secret papers in a nighttime rendezvous , he is shown as driving out of the White House ’ s Northwest Gate .\nThe result was the unspoken assurance of Deep Throat being a White House staffer . The movie audience , after all , saw this with their own eyes !\nSeveral other Deep Throat observations : By far the best description of Deep Throat and his activities is Max Holland ’ s Leak : Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat ( 2012 ) , supplemented by Holland ’ s extensive critical review of the 2017 film Mark Felt .

In an unpublished interview cited by Jeff Himmelman in Yours in Truth : A Personal Portrait of Ben Bradlee , Legendary Editor of The Washington Post ( 2012 ) , Bradlee expressed his own doubts as to the authenticity of the Deep Throat story :\nYou know I have a little problem with Deep Throat.… Did that potted [ plant ] incident ever happen ? … and meeting in some garage .

         "The New York Times has decided to blame the El Paso murders not on the actual killer but on “ conservative media stars. ” As here .\nSpecifically , by name , that would be the Fox News evening lineup of Tucker Carlson , Sean Hannity , and Laura Ingraham . Then it goes on to talk radio ’ s Rush Limbaugh , plus Fox and Friends ’ Brian Kilmeade , Fox ’ s Jeanine Pirro , and Ann Coulter . Thrown in along the way were “ outlets like Sinclair Broadcast Group and The Drudge Report to platforms like Breitbart News and Gateway Pundit , ” with a specific mention of Sinclair ’ s Boris Epshteyn . And oh yes , there was a reference to former Nixon and Reagan aide and columnist Pat Buchanan .\nSuffice to say , the smear instantly backfired on the Times itself . Big time .\nThere is a striking degree of overlap between the words of right-wing media personalities and the language used by the Texas man who confessed to killing 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso this month . In a 2,300-word screed posted on the website 8chan , the killer wrote that he was “ simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion . ”\nGot that ? There was a “ striking degree of overlap ” between the language of these conservative media stars and “ the language used by ” the El Paso killer in his so-called “ manifesto . ”\nWell , now . What did the Times story mysteriously leave out ? This .\nTo borrow from the Times , “ There is a striking degree of overlap between the words of left-wing Democratic presidential candidates and the New York Times and the language used by ” the Texas shooter .\nThe inconvenient truth is that our leaders , both Democrat AND Republican , have been failing us for decades . They are either complacent or involved in one of the biggest betrayals of the American public in our history . The takeover of the United States government by unchecked corporations .\nWhere would the killer get such an idea ? Where would he pick up such anti-corporate language ?\nHe could start by reading this November 25 , 2018 column by New York Times opinion columnist David Leonhardt titled :\nThe Monopolization of America In one industry after another , big companies have become more dominant over the past 15 years , new data show .\nIn which the Times columnist says this ( bold print supplied ) :\nHostility to corporate bigness animated Thomas Jefferson and Teddy Roosevelt , as well as the labor movement , Granger movement , Progressive movement and more . Of course , monopolies and other corporate giants have fought back against these assaults on their power , and sometimes succeeded for years or decades at a time . It happened during the age of Rockefeller and Morgan . Over the past 40 years , it has happened again . The federal government , under presidents of both parties , has largely surrendered to monopoly power . “ The ‘ anti ’ in ‘ antitrust ’ has been discarded , ” as the legal scholar Tim Wu puts it in his new book , “ The Curse of Bigness. ” Washington allows most megamergers to proceed either straight up or with only fig-leaf changes . The government has also done nothing to prevent the emergence of dominant new technology companies that mimic the old AT & T monopoly .\nThen there was this language by another Times columnist , Farhad Manjoo , assailing five specific corporations :\nIn which Manjoo says this of big corporations “ Amazon , Apple , Facebook , Microsoft and Alphabet , the parent company of Google ” :\nThis is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism : We are , all of us , in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy .\nManjoo closes by saying this of the dominance by these five giant corporations : “ It ’ s too late to escape . ”\nNot to be left out is this Times jewel assailing corporations , this one written by Steven Davidoff Solomon , identified as “ a professor of law at the University of California , Berkeley. ” The Times published Professor Solomon as saying this of big corporations and their use of “ corporate inversions ” :\nIf you thought there was a problem with inversions — deals that allow American companies to relocate their headquarters to lower their tax bills — wait until you hear about the real secret to avoiding corporate taxes . It ’ s called earnings stripping , and it is a technique that the Obama administration has so far failed to stop . The public outcry over the use of inversions is now entering its third year . Pfizer is trying the biggest one yet , a $ 152 billion deal for Allergan , the maker of Botox , which is based in Dublin . The flight of American icons like Pfizer has led to complaints that corporations are gaming the system to lower the taxes they pay to Washington . At the same time , the companies stay in the United States , getting all the benefits of our country .\nOne could go on and on with examples of New York Times language assailing the power of corporations , their evasions of taxes , and more . Language that matches exactly the language of the El Paso shooter . But let ’ s move on to Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .\nWarren , it turns out , had a fan in the Dayton , Ohio , shooter . And Warren ’ s language on corporations and their power couldn ’ t be missed . Examples ?\nHere is the Atlantic running a piece on Warren ’ s views on corporate power as written by Stacy Mitchell , “ Co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. ” The headline :\nThe Atlantic story says that Warren believes “ that big corporations ’ political influence and market dominance are killing smaller rivals , and that small-business owners share interests with other victims of corporate power . ”\nReplying to Mitt Romney ’ s statement in 2008 that “ corporations are people , ” Warren said :\nNo , Governor Romney , corporations are not people . People have hearts , they have kids , they get jobs , they get sick , they love , and they die . And that matters . That matter because we don ’ t run this country for corporations , we run it for people . People feel the system is rigged against them . And here ’ s the painful part . They ’ re right . The system is rigged . Look around . Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies . Wall Street CEOs — the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs — still strut around Congress , no shame , demanding favors , and acting like we should thank them .\nThere is infinitely more of Warren assailing corporate power , but let ’ s move to Bernie Sanders . Here is Sanders saying this on page 273 of his book Our Revolution :\nCorporate tax reform must start by preventing profitable companies from sheltering profits in tax haven countries like the Cayman Islands . In 2015 , I introduced legislation with Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois to do just that . The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would end the loophole that allows corporations to defer paying taxes on overseas profits . Instead , it would require corporations to pay U.S. taxes on offshore profits as they are earned . This bill would take away the tax incentives for corporations to shift profits and move jobs and factories offshore , by taxing their profits no matter where they are generated . American corporations would continue to get a credit against their U.S. tax liability for foreign taxes they pay , but they would have to pay the federal government the difference between the foreign rate and the U.S. rate .\nAlso in the Sanders book was this attack on corporations and their control of the media :\nIn 1983 the largest fifty corporations controlled 90 percent of the media . That ’ s a high level of concentration . Today , as a result of massive mergers and takeovers , six corporations control 90 percent of what we see , hear , and read . This is outrageous , and a real threat to our democracy .\nOn and on and on I could go with attacks on corporations and corporate power by the New York Times and Senators Warren and Sanders — not to mention other Democratic presidential candidates .\nThere is no question that in both exact language and certainly in sentiment the views repeatedly expressed by the Times , Warren , and Sanders matches exactly the language and sentiment of the El Paso killer on corporations and corporate power .\nSurprise ? In this not so-cleverly disguised attack on Tucker , Sean , Laura , Rush , and the rest , the Times mentions nary a peep of the similarity in language between the shooter ’ s “ manifesto ” and the Times itself , as well as Warren and Sanders . Say again : not … a … single … word .\nThe obvious conclusion ? The left-wing paper wanted to shift responsibility for the shooting from the shooter and blame the stars of conservative media .\nBut in playing this game the New York Times managed to hit a decidedly unintended target : the New York Times itself .",

Thrown in along the way were “outlets like Sinclair Broadcast Group and The Drudge Report to platforms like Breitbart News and Gateway Pundit,” with a specific mention of Sinclair’s Boris Epshteyn. And oh yes, there was a reference to former Nixon and Reagan aide and columnist Pat Buchanan.\n\nSuffice to say, the smear instantly backfired on the Times itself. Big time.\n\nLet’s start with the Times’ reasoning on this smear:\n\nThere is a striking degree of overlap between the words of right-wing media personalities and the language used by the Texas man who confessed to killing 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso this month. In a 2,300-word screed posted on the website 8chan, the killer wrote that he was “simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion.”\n\nGot that? There was a “striking degree of overlap” between the language of these conservative media stars and “the language used by” the El Paso killer in his so-called “manifesto.”\n\nWell, now. What did the Times story mysteriously leave out? This.\n\nTo borrow from the Times, “There is a striking degree of overlap between the words of left-wing Democratic presidential candidates and the New York Times and the language used by” the Texas shooter.\n\nLet’s get specific. Says the killer:\n\nThe inconvenient truth is that our leaders, both Democrat AND Republican, have been failing us for decades. They are either complacent or involved in one of the biggest betrayals of the American public in our history. The takeover of the United States government by unchecked corporations.\n\nWhere would the killer get such an idea? Where would he pick up such anti-corporate language?\n\nHe could start by reading this November 25, 2018 column by New York Times opinion columnist David Leonhardt titled:\n\nThe Monopolization of America In one industry after another, big companies have become more dominant over the past 15 years, new data show.\n\nIn which the Times columnist says this (bold print supplied):\n\nHostility to corporate bigness animated Thomas Jefferson and Teddy Roosevelt, as well as the labor movement, Granger movement, Progressive movement and more. Of course, monopolies and other corporate giants have fought back against these assaults on their power, and sometimes succeeded for years or decades at a time. It happened during the age of Rockefeller and Morgan. Over the past 40 years, it has happened again. The federal government, under presidents of both parties, has largely surrendered to monopoly power. “The ‘anti’ in ‘antitrust’ has been discarded,” as the legal scholar Tim Wu puts it in his new book, “The Curse of Bigness.” Washington allows most megamergers to proceed either straight up or with only fig-leaf changes. The government has also done nothing to prevent the emergence of dominant new technology companies that mimic the old AT&T monopoly.\n\nThen there was this language by another Times columnist, Farhad Manjoo, assailing five specific corporations:\n\nTech’s Frightful Five: They’ve Got Us\n\nIn which Manjoo says this of big corporations “Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google”:\n\nThis is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy.\n\nManjoo closes by saying this of the dominance by these five giant corporations: “It’s too late to escape.”\n\nNot to be left out is this Times jewel assailing corporations, this one written by Steven Davidoff Solomon, identified as “a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.” The Times published Professor Solomon as saying this of big corporations and their use of “corporate inversions”:\n\nIf you thought there was a problem with inversions — deals that allow American companies to relocate their headquarters to lower their tax bills — wait until you hear about the real secret to avoiding corporate taxes. It’s called earnings stripping, and it is a technique that the Obama administration has so far failed to stop. The public outcry over the use of inversions is now entering its third year. Pfizer is trying the biggest one yet, a $152 billion deal for Allergan, the maker of Botox, which is based in Dublin. The flight of American icons like Pfizer has led to complaints that corporations are gaming the system to lower the taxes they pay to Washington. At the same time, the companies stay in the United States, getting all the benefits of our country.\n\nOne could go on and on with examples of New York Times language assailing the power of corporations, their evasions of taxes, and more. Language that matches exactly the language of the El Paso shooter. But let’s move on to Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nWarren, it turns out, had a fan in the Dayton, Ohio, shooter. And Warren’s language on corporations and their power couldn’t be missed. Examples?\n\nHere is the Atlantic running a piece on Warren’s views on corporate power as written by Stacy Mitchell, “Co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.” The headline:\n\nElizabeth Warren Has a Theory About Corporate Power\n\nThe Atlantic story says that Warren believes “that big corporations’ political influence and market dominance are killing smaller rivals, and that small-business owners share interests with other victims of corporate power.”\n\nReplying to Mitt Romney’s statement in 2008 that “corporations are people,” Warren said:\n\nNo, Governor Romney, corporations are not people. People have hearts, they have kids, they get jobs, they get sick, they love, and they die. And that matters. That matter because we don’t run this country for corporations, we run it for people. People feel the system is rigged against them. And here’s the painful part. They’re right. The system is rigged. Look around. Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies. Wall Street CEOs — the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs — still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them.\n\nThere is infinitely more of Warren assailing corporate power, but let’s move to Bernie Sanders. Here is Sanders saying this on page 273 of his book Our Revolution:\n\nCorporate tax reform must start by preventing profitable companies from sheltering profits in tax haven countries like the Cayman Islands. In 2015, I introduced legislation with Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois to do just that. The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would end the loophole that allows corporations to defer paying taxes on overseas profits. Instead, it would require corporations to pay U.S. taxes on offshore profits as they are earned. This bill would take away the tax incentives for corporations to shift profits and move jobs and factories offshore, by taxing their profits no matter where they are generated. American corporations would continue to get a credit against their U.S. tax liability for foreign taxes they pay, but they would have to pay the federal government the difference between the foreign rate and the U.S. rate.\n\nAlso in the Sanders book was this attack on corporations and their control of the media:\n\nIn 1983 the largest fifty corporations controlled 90 percent of the media. That’s a high level of concentration. Today, as a result of massive mergers and takeovers, six corporations control 90 percent of what we see, hear, and read. This is outrageous, and a real threat to our democracy.\n\nOn and on and on I could go with attacks on corporations and corporate power by the New York Times and Senators Warren and Sanders — not to mention other Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nThere is no question that in both exact language and certainly in sentiment the views repeatedly expressed by the Times, Warren, and Sanders matches exactly the language and sentiment of the El Paso killer on corporations and corporate power.\n\nSurprise? In this not so-cleverly disguised attack on Tucker, Sean, Laura, Rush, and the rest, the Times mentions nary a peep of the similarity in language between the shooter’s “manifesto” and the Times itself, as well as Warren and Sanders. Say again: not … a … single … word.\n\nThe obvious conclusion? The left-wing paper wanted to shift responsibility for the shooting from the shooter and blame the stars of conservative media.\n\nBut in playing this game the New York Times managed to hit a decidedly unintended target: the New York Times itself.\n\nOops!",

         "WASHINGTON – For the first time in his presidency , Donald Trump gave his State of the Union address to a divided Congress . The president did n't flinch as he faced a House of Representatives led by Democrats who have recently pushed for late-term abortions .\nTrump boldly pushed back on that agenda , saying America 's leaders need to `` work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life . '' The president then called on Congress to pass legislation to prohibit late-term abortions .\n`` Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother 's womb moments before birth , '' Trump said . `` These are living , feeling , beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world . ''\n`` And then , we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth , '' the president continued . `` All children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of God .

         "2015-05-06",
         "Erica Werner",
         "A high-ranking State Department official said Wednesday it 's `` not acceptable '' for any agency employee to conduct government business on a private email server as former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton did .\nJoyce Barr , the agency 's chief freedom of information officer , made the comment under questioning from Republican senators who used a Senate Judiciary hearing on open records laws to attack Clinton over her email practices .\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas said that Clinton 's approach amounted to a `` premeditated and deliberate '' attempt to avoid open records requirements .\nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said that anyone who took such an approach should be fired , and asked Barr whether it would be considered acceptable .\nBarr said that she had not been aware of Clinton 's decision to conduct all her State Department email on a private server but that the agency has now made it clear to employees that such an approach would not be acceptable .\n`` I think that the actions that we 've taken in the course of recovering these emails have made it very clear what people 's responsibilities are with regard to record-keeping , '' she said . `` We continue to do training , we 've sent department notices , telegrams , we 've talked to directors and I think the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable . ''\nClinton , who is running for president , has defended using a personal email account while serving as secretary of state as a matter of personal convenience . She says she has turned over to the State Department all work-related emails — more than 30,000 of them — though House Republicans investigating the 2012 attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi , Libya , are demanding more . They insist the server itself should be examined by a third party .\nA spokesman for Clinton 's campaign declined comment . Clinton has agreed to testify on Capitol Hill later this month at the request of the special committee investigating the Benghazi attacks .\nBarr acknowledged problems with the State Department 's overall performance responding to open records requests , calling an existing backlog of 18,000 requests `` unacceptable .

         "A high-ranking State Department official said Wednesday it's \"not acceptable\" for any agency employee to conduct government business on a private email server as former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton did.\n\nJoyce Barr, the agency's chief freedom of information officer, made the comment under questioning from Republican senators who used a Senate Judiciary hearing on open records laws to attack Clinton over her email practices.\n\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas said that Clinton's approach amounted to a \"premeditated and deliberate\" attempt to avoid open records requirements.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said that anyone who took such an approach should be fired, and asked Barr whether it would be considered acceptable.\n\nBarr said that she had not been aware of Clinton's decision to conduct all her State Department email on a private server but that the agency has now made it clear to employees that such an approach would not be acceptable.\n\n\"I think that the actions that we've taken in the course of recovering these emails have made it very clear what people's responsibilities are with regard to record-keeping,\" she said. \"We continue to do training, we've sent department notices, telegrams, we've talked to directors and I think the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable.\"\n\nClinton, who is running for president, has defended using a personal email account while serving as secretary of state as a matter of personal convenience. She says she has turned over to the State Department all work-related emails — more than 30,000 of them — though House Republicans investigating the 2012 attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, are demanding more. They insist the server itself should be examined by a third party.\n\nA spokesman for Clinton's campaign declined comment. Clinton has agreed to testify on Capitol Hill later this month at the request of the special committee investigating the Benghazi attacks.\n\nBarr acknowledged problems with the State Department's overall performance responding to open records requests, calling an existing backlog of 18,000 requests \"unacceptable.\" But she insisted improvements were being made even as the number of requests keeps growing and the agency is understaffed. Like other government agencies, the State Department is bound by laws including the Freedom of Information Act that generally require them to maintain records and make them available to the public when asked, with some exceptions.\n\nKaren Kaiser, general counsel at The Associated Press, testified that despite promises of greater transparency by the Obama administration, most agencies are not abiding by their legal obligations under open records laws. \"Non-responsiveness is the norm, and the reflex at most agencies is to withhold information, not to release it,\" she told senators.\n\nLawmakers are weighing legislation to improve the Freedom of Information Act, but Kaiser said agencies should also be made to comply with the laws already enacted.\n\n\"We can have all the wonderful laws on the books and the presumptions of disclosure written in, but if the agencies don't abide by the requirements we're in a bad position,\" she said.",

         "Robert Reich Blog",
         "As a first step , I believe it necessary for the members and leadership of the Democratic National Committee to step down and be replaced by people who are determined to create a party that represents America – including all those who feel powerless and disenfranchised , and who have been left out of our politics and left behind in our economy .\nThe Democratic Party as it is now constituted has become a giant fundraising machine , too often reflecting the goals and values of the moneyed interests . This must change . The election of 2016 has repudiated it . We need a people ’ s party – a party capable of organizing and mobilizing Americans in opposition to Donald Trump ’ s Republican party , which is about to take over all three branches of the U.S. government . We need a New Democratic Party that will fight against intolerance and widening inequality .\nWhat happened in America Tuesday should not be seen as a victory for hatefulness over decency . It is more accurately understood as a repudiation of the American power structure .\nAt the core of that structure are the political leaders of both parties , their political operatives , and fundraisers ; the major media , centered in New York and Washington DC ; the country ’ s biggest corporations , their top executives , and Washington lobbyists and trade associations ; the biggest Wall Street banks , their top officers , traders , hedge-fund and private-equity managers , and their lackeys in Washington ; and the wealthy individuals who invest directly in politics .\nAt the start of the 2016 election cycle , this power structure proclaimed Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush shoo-ins for the nominations of the Democratic and Republican parties . After all , both of these individuals had deep bases of funders , well-established networks of political insiders , experienced political advisers and all the political name recognition any candidate could possibly want .\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the White House . The presidency was won by Donald Trump , who made his fortune marketing office towers and casinos , and , more recently , starring in a popular reality-television program , and who has never held elective office or had anything to do with the Republican party . Hillary Clinton narrowly won the popular vote , but not enough of the states and their electors secure a victory .\nHillary Clinton ’ s defeat is all the more remarkable in that her campaign vastly outspent the Trump campaign on television and radio advertisements , and get-out-the-vote efforts . Moreover , her campaign had the support in the general election not of only the kingpins of the Democratic party but also many leading Republicans , including most of the politically active denizens of Wall Street and the top executives of America ’ s largest corporations , and even former Republican president George HW Bush . Her campaign team was run by seasoned professionals who knew the ropes . She had the visible and forceful backing of Barack Obama , whose popularity has soared in recent months , and his popular wife . And , of course , she had her husband .\nTrump , by contrast , was shunned by the power structure . Mitt Romney , the Republican presidential candidate in 2012 , actively worked against Trump ’ s nomination . Many senior Republicans refused to endorse him , or even give him their support . The Republican National Committee did not raise money for Trump to the extent it had for other Republican candidates for president .\nThere had been hints of the political earthquake to come . Trump had won the Republican primaries , after all . More tellingly , Clinton had been challenged in the Democratic primaries by the unlikeliest of candidates – a 74-year-old Jewish senator from Vermont who described himself as a democratic socialist and who was not even a Democrat . Bernie Sanders went on to win 22 states and 47 percent of the vote in those primaries . Sanders ’ major theme was that the country ’ s political and economic system was rigged in favor of big corporations , Wall Street and the very wealthy .\nThe power structure of America wrote off Sanders as an aberration , and , until recently , didn ’ t take Trump seriously . A respected political insider recently told me most Americans were largely content with the status quo . “ The economy is in good shape , ” he said . “ Most Americans are better off than they ’ ve been in years . ”\nRecent economic indicators may be up , but those indicators don ’ t reflect the insecurity most Americans continue to feel , nor the seeming arbitrariness and unfairness they experience . Nor do the major indicators show the linkages many Americans see between wealth and power , stagnant or declining real wages , soaring CEO pay , and the undermining of democracy by big money .\nMedian family income is lower now than it was 16 years ago , adjusted for inflation . Workers without college degrees – the old working class – have fallen furthest . Most economic gains , meanwhile , have gone to top . These gains have translated into political power to elicit bank bailouts , corporate subsidies , special tax loopholes , favorable trade deals and increasing market power without interference by anti-monopoly enforcement – all of which have further reduced wages and pulled up profits .\nWealth , power and crony capitalism fit together . Americans know a takeover has occurred , and they blame the establishment for it .\nThe Democratic party once represented the working class . But over the last three decades the party has been taken over by Washington-based fundraisers , bundlers , analysts , and pollsters who have focused instead on raising campaign money from corporate and Wall Street executives and getting votes from upper middle-class households in “ swing ” suburbs .\nDemocrats have occupied the White House for 16 of the last 24 years , and for four of those years had control of both houses of Congress . But in that time they failed to reverse the decline in working-class wages and economic security . Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ardently pushed for free trade agreements without providing millions of blue-collar workers who thereby lost their jobs means of getting new ones that paid at least as well .\nThey stood by as corporations hammered trade unions , the backbone of the white working class – failing to reform labor laws to impose meaningful penalties on companies that violate them , or help workers form unions with simple up-or-down votes . Partly as a result , union membership sank from 22 percent of all workers when Bill Clinton was elected president to less than 12 percenttoday , and the working class lost bargaining leverage to get a share of the economy ’ s gains .\nBill Clinton and Obama also allowed antitrust enforcement to ossify – with the result that large corporations have grown far larger , and major industries more concentrated . The unsurprising result of this combination – more trade , declining unionization and more industry concentration – has been to shift political and economic power to big corporations and the wealthy , and to shaft the working class . This created an opening for Donald Trump ’ s authoritarian demagoguery , and his presidency .\nNow Americans have rebelled by supporting someone who wants to fortify America against foreigners as well as foreign-made goods . The power structure understandably fears that Trump ’ s isolationism will stymie economic growth . But most Americans couldn ’ t care less about growth because for years they have received few of its benefits , while suffering most of its burdens in the forms of lost jobs and lower wages .\nThe power structure is shocked by the outcome of the 2016 election because it has cut itself off from the lives of most Americans . Perhaps it also doesn ’ t wish to understand , because that would mean acknowledging its role in enabling the presidency of Donald Trump .\nRobert Reich , one of the nation ’ s leading experts on work and the economy , is Chancellor ’ s Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley . He has served in three national administrations , most recently as secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton . Time Magazine has named him one of the ten most effective cabinet secretaries of the last century . He has written 13 books , including his latest best-seller , “ Aftershock : The Next Economy and America ’ s Future ; ” “ The Work of Nations , ” which has been translated into 22 languages ; and his newest , an e-book , “ Beyond Outrage. ” His syndicated columns , television appearances , and public radio commentaries reach millions of people each week . He is also a founding editor of the American Prospect magazine , and Chairman of the citizen ’ s group Common Cause . His new movie `` Inequality for All '' is in Theaters . His widely-read blog can be found at www.robertreich.org .",

It is more accurately understood as a repudiation of the American power structure.\n\nAt the core of that structure are the political leaders of both parties, their political operatives, and fundraisers; the major media, centered in New York and Washington DC; the country’s biggest corporations, their top executives, and Washington lobbyists and trade associations; the biggest Wall Street banks, their top officers, traders, hedge-fund and private-equity managers, and their lackeys in Washington; and the wealthy individuals who invest directly in politics.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAt the start of the 2016 election cycle, this power structure proclaimed Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush shoo-ins for the nominations of the Democratic and Republican parties. After all, both of these individuals had deep bases of funders, well-established networks of political insiders, experienced political advisers and all the political name recognition any candidate could possibly want.\n\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the White House. The presidency was won by Donald Trump, who made his fortune marketing office towers and casinos, and, more recently, starring in a popular reality-television program, and who has never held elective office or had anything to do with the Republican party. Hillary Clinton narrowly won the popular vote, but not enough of the states and their electors secure a victory.\n\nHillary Clinton’s defeat is all the more remarkable in that her campaign vastly outspent the Trump campaign on television and radio advertisements, and get-out-the-vote efforts. Moreover, her campaign had the support in the general election not of only the kingpins of the Democratic party but also many leading Republicans, including most of the politically active denizens of Wall Street and the top executives of America’s largest corporations, and even former Republican president George HW Bush. Her campaign team was run by seasoned professionals who knew the ropes. She had the visible and forceful backing of Barack Obama, whose popularity has soared in recent months, and his popular wife. And, of course, she had her husband.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTrump, by contrast, was shunned by the power structure. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate in 2012, actively worked against Trump’s nomination. Many senior Republicans refused to endorse him, or even give him their support. The Republican National Committee did not raise money for Trump to the extent it had for other Republican candidates for president.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThere had been hints of the political earthquake to come. Trump had won the Republican primaries, after all. More tellingly, Clinton had been challenged in the Democratic primaries by the unlikeliest of candidates – a 74-year-old Jewish senator from Vermont who described himself as a democratic socialist and who was not even a Democrat. Bernie Sanders went on to win 22 states and 47 percent of the vote in those primaries. Sanders’ major theme was that the country’s political and economic system was rigged in favor of big corporations, Wall Street and the very wealthy.\n\nThe power structure of America wrote off Sanders as an aberration, and, until recently, didn’t take Trump seriously. A respected political insider recently told me most Americans were largely content with the status quo. “The economy is in good shape,” he said. “Most Americans are better off than they’ve been in years.”\n\nRecent economic indicators may be up, but those indicators don’t reflect the insecurity most Americans continue to feel, nor the seeming arbitrariness and unfairness they experience. Nor do the major indicators show the linkages many Americans see between wealth and power, stagnant or declining real wages, soaring CEO pay, and the undermining of democracy by big money.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMedian family income is lower now than it was 16 years ago, adjusted for inflation. Workers without college degrees – the old working class – have fallen furthest. Most economic gains, meanwhile, have gone to top. These gains have translated into political power to elicit bank bailouts, corporate subsidies, special tax loopholes, favorable trade deals and increasing market power without interference by anti-monopoly enforcement – all of which have further reduced wages and pulled up profits.\n\nWealth, power and crony capitalism fit together. Americans know a takeover has occurred, and they blame the establishment for it.\n\nThe Democratic party once represented the working class. But over the last three decades the party has been taken over by Washington-based fundraisers, bundlers, analysts, and pollsters who have focused instead on raising campaign money from corporate and Wall Street executives and getting votes from upper middle-class households in “swing” suburbs.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nDemocrats have occupied the White House for 16 of the last 24 years, and for four of those years had control of both houses of Congress. But in that time they failed to reverse the decline in working-class wages and economic security. Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ardently pushed for free trade agreements without providing millions of blue-collar workers who thereby lost their jobs means of getting new ones that paid at least as well.\n\nThey stood by as corporations hammered trade unions, the backbone of the white working class – failing to reform labor laws to impose meaningful penalties on companies that violate them, or help workers form unions with simple up-or-down votes. Partly as a result, union membership sank from 22 percent of all workers when Bill Clinton was elected president to less than 12 percenttoday, and the working class lost bargaining leverage to get a share of the economy’s gains.\n\nBill Clinton and Obama also allowed antitrust enforcement to ossify – with the result that large corporations have grown far larger, and major industries more concentrated. The unsurprising result of this combination – more trade, declining unionization and more industry concentration – has been to shift political and economic power to big corporations and the wealthy, and to shaft the working class. This created an opening for Donald Trump’s authoritarian demagoguery, and his presidency.\n\nNow Americans have rebelled by supporting someone who wants to fortify America against foreigners as well as foreign-made goods. The power structure understandably fears that Trump’s isolationism will stymie economic growth. But most Americans couldn’t care less about growth because for years they have received few of its benefits, while suffering most of its burdens in the forms of lost jobs and lower wages.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe power structure is shocked by the outcome of the 2016 election because it has cut itself off from the lives of most Americans. Perhaps it also doesn’t wish to understand, because that would mean acknowledging its role in enabling the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nRobert Reich, one of the nation’s leading experts on work and the economy, is Chancellor’s Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley.

         "After 10 years of silence - a decade of dodging questions about the infamous stain on her blue dress and the jokes about the president's cigar - Bill Clinton's mistress, Monica Lewinsky, spoke out in Vanity Fair.\n\nRemembering the Monica Lewinsky Scandal\n\nHere's what she had to say:\n\n1. She May Not Stay Quiet if Hillary Runs\n\nLewinsky says she \"remained virtually reclusive\" during Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign despite repeated interview requests. Now that Hillary is reportedly mulling a 2016 bid, Lewinsky finds herself \"gun-shy yet again, fearful of 'becoming an issue' should she decide to ramp up her campaign.\" But she's not sure she'll stay quiet this time.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who says she's still recognized everywhere she goes, has had enough of \"tiptoeing around my past - and other people's futures.\"\n\nSo though she acknowledges speaking out may have severe ramifications, \"I've decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past … It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress.\"\n\n2.

The Relationship Was Consensual\n\nLewinsky maintains that her relationship with Clinton was voluntary.\n\n\"Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship,\" Lewinsky writes. \"Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position.\"\n\nNevertheless, she says, she \"regrets\" the relationship. \"Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened.,\" she writes.\n\n4. The Clintons Didn't Pay Her Off\n\nThe Clintons didn't bribe her to stay quiet, Lewinsky insists.\n\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" she writes.

She Contemplated Suicide\n\nThough she never actually attempted suicide, Lewinsky says she was tempted end her own life as \"the shame, the scorn, and the fear\" washed over her.\n\nShe says the tragic suicide of 18-year-old Tyler Clementi, the gay Rutgers student who was filmed kissing another man, brought back those terrible memories and inspired her to come forward.\n\n\"Perhaps by sharing my story … I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation,\" Lewinksi says.",

         "2019-09-24",
         "Oliver Jj Lane",
         "The United Kingdom Supreme Court has ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was acting unlawfully when he suspended Parliament in August for five weeks , a move which anti-Brexit campaigners claimed was intended to thwart their attempts to prevent Britain leaving the European Union .\nIn a shock ruling which strongly went against the government on every count , the Supreme Court in London unanimously found Tuesday morning that Boris Johnson ’ s decision to suspend Parliament was not only unlawful but was null and void , meaning it legally did not take place . Parliament is now free to sit again as soon as desired by the speakers of both houses , the court explained .\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now reacted , speaking to the BBC on a balcony of the United Nations building in New York , insisting that despite the court ruling against him this morning Brexit would still be going ahead at the end of October as planned .\nIn remarks that have already angered remainers , the Prime Minister said he regretted the decision of the court but pointed out the coalition of anti-Brexit campaigners who have worked tirelessly to prevent Britain ’ s withdrawal from going ahead .\nAs I say , I strongly disagree with this decision of the supreme court , I have the utmost respect for our judiciary , I don ’ think this was the right decision I think that the prerogative of prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge . It is perfectly usual to have Queen ’ s speech , that ’ s what we want to do . More importantly , let ’ s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit . There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU . We have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued , doesn ’ t want to have an election , and I think it is time we took things forward . …as the law currently stands , the UK leaves the EU on October the 31st come what may , but the interesting , exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal and that ’ s what we are working on . And I ’ ll be honest with you… it is not made much easier by this kind of stuff in Parliament and the courts . Obviously getting a deal is not made much easier against this background but we ’ ve got to get on and do it . …As the law stands we leave on October the 31st and I am very hopeful that we will get a deal , and I think what the people of the country want is to see Parliamentarians coming together , working in the national interest to get this thing done , and that is what we are going to do .\nA government spokesman has said the Prime Minister will not resign , and he will return to the United Kingdom tonight after his speech to the United Nations .\nUpdate 1305 : Farage calls Boris proroguing parliament “ worst political decision ever ”\nBrexit leader Nigel Farage has no sympathy for Boris Johnson ’ s unforced error and has said his chief advisor Dominic Cummings — who has frequently crossed swords with Farage & co in the past — should step down over the affair which he is widely thought to have engineered .\nSpeaking to Breitbart London before the ruling was made , Mr Farage said : “ We have a Parliament that twice has stopped us from having a General Election and instead we have a Supreme Court making a decision as to whether Boris Johnson remains prime minister ; virtually , that ’ s how important the ruling is .\n“ I don ’ t like it one little bit and I think our whole constitution has been thrown completely up into the air by Speaker Bercow and others . ”\nRead that and the responses of other political figures at Breitbart London\nThe Supreme Court was the creation of the Blair years of government , a time of enormous constitutional and political change in the United Kingdom . As Breitbart London ’ s James Delingpole has it , the court Blair created is now doing his bidding . Read more here\nDelingpole : Judicial Enemies of the People Sabotage Brexit Again https : //t.co/GwteWW9Wyz — Breitbart London ( @ BreitbartLondon ) September 24 , 2019\nCommons speaker John Bercow has spoken to reporters outside Parliament , answering the questions over when Parliament would resume , given the Supreme Court has given it leave to do so whenever it wishes . The answer is Wednesday morning , with opportunities for members to make urgent questions , request emergency debates , and to hold ministers to account . Expect fireworks .\nBREAKING : Speaker Bercow : Parliament Will ‘ Resume ’ Wednesday After Supreme Court Nullification of Suspension https : //t.co/2kWH5SaOKa — Breitbart London ( @ BreitbartLondon ) September 24 , 2019\nAnti-Brexit politicians have leapt upon the ruling as resembling a fatal blow against Boris Johnson , who it is claimed could be the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history if he were ousted now . But what or who could replace Mr Johnson is not clear as no single party can command a majority in Parliament .\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed his party ’ s annual conference in Brighton as the ruling was made , and told the delegates there that the Prime Minister should “ consider his position ” . Speaking outside the Supreme Court former Tory MP turned independent Anna Soubry also called on the Prime Minister to resign , saying it was time for what she unironically calls a government of national unity to take power . Presumably formed of a coalition of opposition parties , the purpose of the much-discussed “ unity ” government would be to overturn Brexit , it has been claimed — despite delivering Brexit being the majority position in the United Kingdom .\nThe first question was whether the court even had the right to consider the question — a matter of jurisdiction . Some had argued the division of powers under the UK constitution meant it would not be proper for the unelected judiciary to make decisions on the acts of the executive — the government — but the court disagreed , stating they believed they had the right . In the words of Lady Brenda Hale who read out the unanimous decision of the 11 justices , the matter was “ judicable ” , and for for them to decide on .\nLady Hale explained : “ …this was not an ordinary prorogation in the run-up to a Queen ’ s speech . It prevented Parliament from carrying out its constitutional role in five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and the exit day on the 31st of October . Proroguing Parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess .\n“ While Parliament is Prorogued , neither house can meet , debate , or pass legislation . Neither house can debate government policy . Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers , or meet and take evidence in committees . ”\nOf the decision to Prorogue itself , Lady Hale said : “ The decision to ask her majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing Parliament from carrying out its constitutional functions without justification . ”\nMr Johnson had used a mechanism known in Westminster parlance as Prorogation to suspend Parliament , usually a normal and regular event in Parliamentary life , but one met this time with outrage by anti-Brexiteers . Normal Parliamentary sessions have lasted between one and two years , being regularly suspended to clear out old unfinished legislation and to allow new government programmes to be launched .\nBut amid the endless Parliamentary discussion over whether to honour the result of the 2016 referendum which saw the British people vote by a margin of over one million votes — the largest democratic mandate given in British history — this Parliamentary session has rumbled on , becoming the longest since the infamous ‘ long Parliament ’ of the English Civil War .\nThe government under Mr Johnson insisted given those circumstances , and the fact the UK government has not yet been able to introduce new domestic legislation , it was reasonable to suspend Parliament .\nAnti-Brexit activists claim the Prime Minister not only lied to the country , but lied to the Queen , as under the British constitutional system she has to be asked as a formality to suspend Parliament .\nThe Associated Press has created this handy timeline of the most recent events leading up to today , to give some context for today ’ s ruling :\nJuly 24 , 2019 : Boris Johnson becomes prime minister after winning a party leadership contest to succeed Theresa May .

         "The United Kingdom Supreme Court has ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was acting unlawfully when he suspended Parliament in August for five weeks, a move which anti-Brexit campaigners claimed was intended to thwart their attempts to prevent Britain leaving the European Union.\n\nIn a shock ruling which strongly went against the government on every count, the Supreme Court in London unanimously found Tuesday morning that Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament was not only unlawful but was null and void, meaning it legally did not take place. Parliament is now free to sit again as soon as desired by the speakers of both houses, the court explained.\n\nUpdate 1330: Boris Johnson speaks\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now reacted, speaking to the BBC on a balcony of the United Nations building in New York, insisting that despite the court ruling against him this morning Brexit would still be going ahead at the end of October as planned.\n\nIn remarks that have already angered remainers, the Prime Minister said he regretted the decision of the court but pointed out the coalition of anti-Brexit campaigners who have worked tirelessly to prevent Britain’s withdrawal from going ahead.\n\nThe Prime Minister told the BBC:\n\nAs I say, I strongly disagree with this decision of the supreme court, I have the utmost respect for our judiciary, I don’ think this was the right decision I think that the prerogative of prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge. It is perfectly usual to have Queen’s speech, that’s what we want to do. More importantly, let’s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit. There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU. We have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued, doesn’t want to have an election, and I think it is time we took things forward. …as the law currently stands, the UK leaves the EU on October the 31st come what may, but the interesting, exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal and that’s what we are working on. And I’ll be honest with you… it is not made much easier by this kind of stuff in Parliament and the courts. Obviously getting a deal is not made much easier against this background but we’ve got to get on and do it. …As the law stands we leave on October the 31st and I am very hopeful that we will get a deal, and I think what the people of the country want is to see Parliamentarians coming together, working in the national interest to get this thing done, and that is what we are going to do.\n\nA government spokesman has said the Prime Minister will not resign, and he will return to the United Kingdom tonight after his speech to the United Nations.\n\nUpdate 1305: Farage calls Boris proroguing parliament “worst political decision ever”\n\nBrexit leader Nigel Farage has no sympathy for Boris Johnson’s unforced error and has said his chief advisor Dominic Cummings — who has frequently crossed swords with Farage & co in the past — should step down over the affair which he is widely thought to have engineered.\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart London before the ruling was made, Mr Farage said: “We have a Parliament that twice has stopped us from having a General Election and instead we have a Supreme Court making a decision as to whether Boris Johnson remains prime minister; virtually, that’s how important the ruling is.\n\n“I don’t like it one little bit and I think our whole constitution has been thrown completely up into the air by Speaker Bercow and others.”\n\nRead that and the responses of other political figures at Breitbart London\n\nUpdate 1255: Tony Blair’s lingering influence on British politics\n\nThe Supreme Court was the creation of the Blair years of government, a time of enormous constitutional and political change in the United Kingdom. As Breitbart London’s James Delingpole has it, the court Blair created is now doing his bidding.

The answer is Wednesday morning, with opportunities for members to make urgent questions, request emergency debates, and to hold ministers to account. Expect fireworks.\n\nBREAKING: Speaker Bercow: Parliament Will ‘Resume’ Wednesday After Supreme Court Nullification of Suspension https://t.co/2kWH5SaOKa — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 24, 2019\n\nUpdate 1115: Calls for the Prime Minister to resign\n\nAnti-Brexit politicians have leapt upon the ruling as resembling a fatal blow against Boris Johnson, who it is claimed could be the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history if he were ousted now.

         "Today is newly seated Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch 's first day at the office hearing cases . He is apparently not going to be a quiet , Clarence Thomas-style justice and asked several questions during the first case before the court .\nBefore this morning 's case—which is a procedurally-oriented matter about the processes required appeal federal work discrimination complaints—the Supreme Court released its list of orders from last week 's conference and decided not to take any new cases as yet . Gorsuch did not participate in this last conference but will for the next one .\nThis matters because the Supreme Court has repeatedly declined to make a decision whether to take a high-profile case about businesses declining to serve gay weddings and has been bumping it to future conferences since last December . It rescheduled the case yet again this morning .\nThat case is Masterpiece Cakeshop Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission . This is a case about wedding cakes , gay marriage , and whether businesses can decline to provide their goods and services on the basis of religious beliefs . Jack Phillips , owners of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood , Colorado , declined ( all the way back in 2013 ) to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple 's wedding . This decision ran him afoul of Colorado 's public accommodation laws , which forbid discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation .\nPhillips ' response , as we have seen in many of these cases , is that he 's not refusing to serve gay people , but he has religious objections to gay marriage and sees being obligated to make a wedding cake as being compelled to put his stamp of approval on it . Courts across the country have disagreed with Phillips and other businesses that serve weddings , like florists and photographers . Courts have thus far declined to accept the argument that refusing to serve gay weddings is somehow different from refusing to serve gay people . Furthermore courts have declined to accept the claim that floral arrangements or wedding cakes are a form of protected expression and that compliance with law compels speech or forces people to compromise their religious beliefs .\nThat the Supreme Court kept pushing back a decision on whether to take this case until now is significant because they 've already previously rejected to hear a similar fight . A photographer in New Mexico tried to get the court in 2014 to hear their case where the state told them they could n't refuse to provide their services for a gay couple 's wedding . The photography company , like Masterpiece Cakeshop , lost their challenge to the law , and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case .\nNow , three years later , the court appears to be delaying a decision at least until Gorsuch has been seated . There have n't been any cases where higher courts have accepted the arguments of the religious shop owners , so there 's no `` split '' that requires the Supreme Court to resolve .

         "More Democrats call for impeachment after Mueller makes statement",
         null,
         null,
         "Three more prominent US Democrats have called for the impeachment of President Trump , after Special Counsel Robert Mueller made his first public remarks .\nSpeaking on Wednesday , Mr Mueller said his investigation had not exonerated Mr Trump of obstruction of justice , contradicting the president 's claims .\nMr Mueller was tasked with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election .\nHe said charging a sitting president with a crime was not an option .\nThe issue of impeachment has divided the Democratic Party , pitting a growing number of lawmakers against Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the house and the most senior Democrat . Ms Pelosi has so far resisted the idea , arguing that it would be counter-productive .\nBut Mr Mueller 's remarks prompted three leading Democratic presidential hopefuls to join the chorus calling for impeachment , bringing the total to 10 of 23 declared candidates .\nAt the White House on Thursday morning , Mr Trump said Mr Mueller was `` a totally conflicted person '' and a `` true Never Trumper '' , referring to his Republican critics in the 2016 White House race .\nHe also said impeachment was a `` dirty , filthy disgusting word '' and the inquiry was `` a giant presidential harassment '' .\nIn response to Mr Mueller 's remarks , Democratic candidates Cory Booker , Kirsten Gillibrand and Pete Buttigieg publicly advocated for the first time for impeachment .\n`` Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately , '' said Mr Booker , a senator from New Jersey .\nNew York Senator Ms Gillibrand said it was `` time for Republicans and Democrats to begin impeachment hearings and follow the facts wherever they may lead '' .\nIndiana mayor Pete Buttigieg tweeted : `` This is as close to an impeachment referral as it gets . ''\nOther senators reiterated earlier calls for impeachment . `` It is up to Congress to hold this president accountable . We need to start impeachment proceedings , '' said California senator Kamala Harris .\nVermont senator Bernie Sanders stopped short of endorsing proceedings , but said in an Instagram post : `` If the House Judiciary Committee deems it necessary , I will support their decision to open an impeachment inquiry . ''\nResponding to Mr Mueller 's statement , House Speaker Ms Pelosi said : `` The Congress holds sacred its constitutional responsibility to investigate and hold the President accountable for his abuse of power . ''\nMr Trump said on Twitter there was `` insufficient evidence '' against him , `` and therefore , in our Country , a person is innocent '' .\nRepresentative Doug Collins , the most senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , said that `` reinvestigating the special counsel 's findings '' would `` only further divide our country '' .\nThe first Republican congressman to call for Mr Trump 's impeachment , Representative Justin Amash , said : `` The ball is in our court , Congress . ''\nMeanwhile , White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said : `` After two years , the Special Counsel is moving on with his life , and everyone else should do the same . ''\nMr Mueller largely reaffirmed what was in his report , which was released last month to the public , with substantial redactions .\nHe detailed 10 instances where Mr Trump had possibly attempted to impede the investigation , but said that charging the president with a crime was not an option for the special counsel .\n`` The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing , '' he said , in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process .\nHe said that if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump `` clearly did not commit a crime , we would have said so '' .\nMr Mueller said he did not believe it was `` appropriate to speak further '' about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team 's report .\nWith Democratic lawmakers seeking to have him testify in Congress , Mr Mueller said : `` The report is my testimony . ''\nHe also announced the formal closure of the special counsel office and his resignation from the justice department to return to private life .\nRobert Mueller did n't break much new ground in his eight-minute statement announcing the official end of the special counsel investigation . Instead , he highlighted in bold what he views as the key points of nearly two years of work .\nMr Mueller started and ended by emphasising that America during the 2016 election was under attack by malign foreign actors . He said those allegations deserve the attention of every American .\nIn the portion of his investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign , Mr Mueller said there was `` insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy '' - hardly the complete vindication the president asserts .\nWhen it comes to obstruction of justice , he chipped away further at the president 's defences .

         "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Robert Mueller: No confidence that there was no crime\n\nThree more prominent US Democrats have called for the impeachment of President Trump, after Special Counsel Robert Mueller made his first public remarks.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Mr Mueller said his investigation had not exonerated Mr Trump of obstruction of justice, contradicting the president's claims.\n\nMr Mueller was tasked with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHe said charging a sitting president with a crime was not an option.\n\nThe issue of impeachment has divided the Democratic Party, pitting a growing number of lawmakers against Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the house and the most senior Democrat. Ms Pelosi has so far resisted the idea, arguing that it would be counter-productive.\n\nBut Mr Mueller's remarks prompted three leading Democratic presidential hopefuls to join the chorus calling for impeachment, bringing the total to 10 of 23 declared candidates.\n\nAt the White House on Thursday morning, Mr Trump said Mr Mueller was \"a totally conflicted person\" and a \"true Never Trumper\", referring to his Republican critics in the 2016 White House race.\n\nHe also said impeachment was a \"dirty, filthy disgusting word\" and the inquiry was \"a giant presidential harassment\".\n\nWho is calling for impeachment?\n\nIn response to Mr Mueller's remarks, Democratic candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Pete Buttigieg publicly advocated for the first time for impeachment.\n\n\"Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately,\" said Mr Booker, a senator from New Jersey.\n\nNew York Senator Ms Gillibrand said it was \"time for Republicans and Democrats to begin impeachment hearings and follow the facts wherever they may lead\".\n\nIndiana mayor Pete Buttigieg tweeted: \"This is as close to an impeachment referral as it gets.\"\n\nOther senators reiterated earlier calls for impeachment. \"It is up to Congress to hold this president accountable. We need to start impeachment proceedings,\" said California senator Kamala Harris.\n\nVermont senator Bernie Sanders stopped short of endorsing proceedings, but said in an Instagram post: \"If the House Judiciary Committee deems it necessary, I will support their decision to open an impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nResponding to Mr Mueller's statement, House Speaker Ms Pelosi said: \"The Congress holds sacred its constitutional responsibility to investigate and hold the President accountable for his abuse of power.\"\n\nHow did Republicans react?\n\nMr Trump said on Twitter there was \"insufficient evidence\" against him, \"and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent\".\n\nRepresentative Doug Collins, the most senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said that \"reinvestigating the special counsel's findings\" would \"only further divide our country\".\n\nThe first Republican congressman to call for Mr Trump's impeachment, Representative Justin Amash, said: \"The ball is in our court, Congress.\"\n\nMeanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said: \"After two years, the Special Counsel is moving on with his life, and everyone else should do the same.\"\n\nWhat did Mueller say?\n\nMr Mueller largely reaffirmed what was in his report, which was released last month to the public, with substantial redactions.\n\nHe detailed 10 instances where Mr Trump had possibly attempted to impede the investigation, but said that charging the president with a crime was not an option for the special counsel.\n\n\"The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,\" he said, in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions\n\nHe said that if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump \"clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so\".\n\nMr Mueller said he did not believe it was \"appropriate to speak further\" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report.\n\nWith Democratic lawmakers seeking to have him testify in Congress, Mr Mueller said: \"The report is my testimony.\"\n\nHe also announced the formal closure of the special counsel office and his resignation from the justice department to return to private life.\n\nRobert Mueller didn't break much new ground in his eight-minute statement announcing the official end of the special counsel investigation. Instead, he highlighted in bold what he views as the key points of nearly two years of work.\n\nMr Mueller started and ended by emphasising that America during the 2016 election was under attack by malign foreign actors. He said those allegations deserve the attention of every American.\n\nIn the portion of his investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, Mr Mueller said there was \"insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy\" - hardly the complete vindication the president asserts.\n\nWhen it comes to obstruction of justice, he chipped away further at the president's defences. Mr Trump wasn't exonerated, \"charging the president\" wasn't an option. If Mr Mueller has his way, his role in this drama is at an end. His report speaks for itself, he said, and he wouldn't engage in \"conclusions or hypotheticals about the president\".\n\nThat may not be enough for Democrats in Congress, who still want to question Mr Mueller in person. If Mr Mueller is to be believed, however, all they need to know - all he will offer them - is written in the pages of his report.",

In the news pages, Trump’s coverage was so favorable that the New Yorker magazine said the Enquirer embraced him “with sycophantic fervor.”\n\nPositive headlines for Trump, a Republican, were matched by negative stories about his opponents, including Hillary Clinton, a Democrat: An Enquirer front page from 2015 said “Hillary: 6 Months to Live” and accompanied the headline with a picture of an unsmiling Clinton with bags under her eyes.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Chad Day and Jake Pearson contributed to this report.",

         "The Walter Scott outrage nobody is talking about",
         "2015-04-14",
         "Heather Digparton",
         "The horrific story of the unarmed Walter Scott 's death at the hands of Officer Michael Slager continues to reverberate . Aside from the incontrovertible evidence on the tape that the accused officer shot him in the back as if he were doing target practice , there has since emerged more tape of the traffic stop itself and audio of the officer speaking with his superiors on the phone raising even more questions about his state of mind at the time of the shooting . But as journalists have gone back and studied the officer 's record and found that he was previously investigated for taser abuse . And on even further investigation it was found that this jurisdiction is known as `` Taser town '' :\nUntil the eight shots heard ’ round the world , cops in North Charleston , South Carolina , were primarily distinguished by their zesty use of Tasers . As computed by a local newspaper in 2006 , cops there used Tasers 201 times in an 18-month period , averaging once every 40 hours in one six-month stretch and disproportionately upon African Americans . The Charleston Post & Courier did the tally after the death of a mentally ill man named Kip Black , who was tasered six times on one occasion and nine times on another . Black died immediately after the second jolting , though the coroner set the cause of death as cocaine-fueled “ excited delirium syndrome . ”\nIt 's important to note that Taser International has spent large sums convincing local coroners that this syndrome ( which primarily seems to kill people in police custody ) makes it the victim 's responsibility if they have the bad luck to die from being shot full of electricity with a taser . It 's not just illegal drugs in the system which can allegedly cause it . Adrenaline can as well . So if a person fails to remain calm in face of an arrest and finds the feeling of 50,000 volts going through their system to be stressful they have no one to blame but themselves if they die .\nThose who have been following the story of Walter Scott understand the significance of the taser . It 's not just that the officer evidently lied about Scott taking his taser , thus somehow justifying his using lethal force , or the fact that he appears to have tried to plant the taser next to the slain man 's body to cover his tracks . The man who filmed the shooting said this :\n“ I remember the police had control of the situation . He had control of Scott , and Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser . You can hear the sound of the Taser ... before I started recording . I believe he just wanted to get away from the Taser . ”\nIt 's not unusual for people to try to escape from a taser if they can . It is , quite literally , a torture device designed to force compliance with terrible pain . The people of Taser Town , particularly African American men , undoubtedly understand exactly what is going to happen if they find themselves in the custody of a police officer . Here 's one example of how it would likely go down , as reported by The Guardian :\nSlager is among three patrolmen named in a lawsuit filed by Julius Wilson , who said he was arrested after being stopped in his car in August last year . Wilson is also suing the city of North Charleston , the city police department and police chief Eddie Driggers . Speaking at a press conference on Monday , Wilson described Slager and his colleagues as “ bad , corrupt cops ” . He said : “ The use of excessive force or punishment to torture suspects is not something that should be tolerated by the North Charleston police department. ” [ ... ]\nWilson , who has a criminal record , said he was stopped on 25 August because his vehicle had a broken tail light . Scott , 50 , was stopped for the same reason on 5 April before fleeing and being shot dead by Slager . Wilson was stopped by an Officer Edwards , he said , who was joined 10 minutes later by Slager and an officer Clemens despite Wilson calmly “ making small talk and laughing ” . After refusing to step out until he was told why he was being arrested , Wilson claimed , he was forcibly pulled out of his vehicle by Slager and the two other officers . The three then “ forcibly restrained Wilson on his stomach on the pavement face down , ” the lawsuit stated . Despite Wilson “ not moving , nor resisting ” and lying with his hands above his head , the lawsuit claimed , Slager broke a silence among the officers by shouting : “ Watch out ! I ’ m going to tase ! ” He then allegedly “ shot his NCPD-issued taser into Wilson ’ s back ” . The lawsuit alleged Wilson “ writhed in pain from the electric shock ” . It said when Slager warned his colleagues he was about to fire his taser , “ Wilson was cooperating fully ” and allowing the two other officers to place his hands behind his back .\nTasers guidelines vary by department and jurisdiction , but generally their use is only considered reasonable when the subject poses a safety threat . Clearly , shooting an unarmed 50-year-old man when he runs from the taser is not one of those cases . The video of the Scott incident shows that Officer Slager is confused on that issue , to say the least . And it 's just as clear , based on that same standard , that nobody could ever claim such force is justified when presented with an unarmed suspect facing down on the ground , with his hands behind his back .

         "The horrific story of the unarmed Walter Scott's death at the hands of Officer Michael Slager continues to reverberate. Aside from the incontrovertible evidence on the tape that the accused officer shot him in the back as if he were doing target practice, there has since emerged more tape of the traffic stop itself and audio of the officer speaking with his superiors on the phone raising even more questions about his state of mind at the time of the shooting. But as journalists have gone back and studied the officer's record and found that he was previously investigated for taser abuse. And on even further investigation it was found that this jurisdiction is known as \"Taser town\":\n\nUntil the eight shots heard ’round the world, cops in North Charleston, South Carolina, were primarily distinguished by their zesty use of Tasers. As computed by a local newspaper in 2006, cops there used Tasers 201 times in an 18-month period, averaging once every 40 hours in one six-month stretch and disproportionately upon African Americans. The Charleston Post & Courier did the tally after the death of a mentally ill man named Kip Black, who was tasered six times on one occasion and nine times on another. Black died immediately after the second jolting, though the coroner set the cause of death as cocaine-fueled “excited delirium syndrome.”\n\nIt's important to note that Taser International has spent large sums convincing local coroners that this syndrome (which primarily seems to kill people in police custody) makes it the victim's responsibility if they have the bad luck to die from being shot full of electricity with a taser. It's not just illegal drugs in the system which can allegedly cause it. Adrenaline can as well. So if a person fails to remain calm in face of an arrest and finds the feeling of 50,000 volts going through their system to be stressful they have no one to blame but themselves if they die.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThose who have been following the story of Walter Scott understand the significance of the taser. It's not just that the officer evidently lied about Scott taking his taser, thus somehow justifying his using lethal force, or the fact that he appears to have tried to plant the taser next to the slain man's body to cover his tracks. The man who filmed the shooting said this:\n\n“I remember the police had control of the situation. He had control of Scott, and Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser. You can hear the sound of the Taser ... before I started recording. I believe he just wanted to get away from the Taser.”\n\nIt's not unusual for people to try to escape from a taser if they can. It is, quite literally, a torture device designed to force compliance with terrible pain. The people of Taser Town, particularly African American men, undoubtedly understand exactly what is going to happen if they find themselves in the custody of a police officer. Here's one example of how it would likely go down, as reported by The Guardian:\n\nSlager is among three patrolmen named in a lawsuit filed by Julius Wilson, who said he was arrested after being stopped in his car in August last year. Wilson is also suing the city of North Charleston, the city police department and police chief Eddie Driggers. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Wilson described Slager and his colleagues as “bad, corrupt cops”. He said: “The use of excessive force or punishment to torture suspects is not something that should be tolerated by the North Charleston police department.”[...]\n\nWilson, who has a criminal record, said he was stopped on 25 August because his vehicle had a broken tail light. Scott, 50, was stopped for the same reason on 5 April before fleeing and being shot dead by Slager. Wilson was stopped by an Officer Edwards, he said, who was joined 10 minutes later by Slager and an officer Clemens despite Wilson calmly “making small talk and laughing”. After refusing to step out until he was told why he was being arrested, Wilson claimed, he was forcibly pulled out of his vehicle by Slager and the two other officers. The three then “forcibly restrained Wilson on his stomach on the pavement face down,” the lawsuit stated. Despite Wilson “not moving, nor resisting” and lying with his hands above his head, the lawsuit claimed, Slager broke a silence among the officers by shouting: “Watch out! I’m going to tase!” He then allegedly “shot his NCPD-issued taser into Wilson’s back”. The lawsuit alleged Wilson “writhed in pain from the electric shock”. It said when Slager warned his colleagues he was about to fire his taser, “Wilson was cooperating fully” and allowing the two other officers to place his hands behind his back.\n\nTasers guidelines vary by department and jurisdiction, but generally their use is only considered reasonable when the subject poses a safety threat. Clearly, shooting an unarmed 50-year-old man when he runs from the taser is not one of those cases. The video of the Scott incident shows that Officer Slager is confused on that issue, to say the least. And it's just as clear, based on that same standard, that nobody could ever claim such force is justified when presented with an unarmed suspect facing down on the ground, with his hands behind his back. Using a taser in that situation is simply a form of unofficial street justice, a little torture at the hands of the authorities to make a point. Tasers are not simply used in place of lethal force, and they're not always used to force compliance. They are very often used as on-the-spot punishment by police who want to teach citizens a lesson.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTake the now notorious California incident that happened to be filmed by a local news station, in which a man on horseback led police on a chase through the desert.

         "WASHINGTON – ███ News has confirmed that at least a few people walked out of an intense invite-only evangelical meeting this week at Wheaton College after the affair turned into `` crazy Trump bashing . ''\nThe two-day gathering involved a group of faith leaders and was billed as a discussion of the evangelical movement in light of Trump 's presidency . But it became more than that .\nTwo sources with intimate knowledge of the meeting say the first day turned into a lot of `` one-sided venting '' against President Trump and the majority of evangelicals who voted for him .\nBoth sources confirm that the issue of sin came up in discussing how evangelicals could vote for Trump . `` The conversations were difficult , '' according to one source who attended both days of the meeting . `` There was a lament . ''\nAfter that first day , a few people felt so uncomfortable with the rhetoric against Trump they left , forgoing the last day of the conference .\nIt 's important to note that no members of President Trump 's faith advisory group were present or ever officially invited .\nRather , this group of evangelicals consisted of many who hold more moderate or progressive views on certain public policy issues .\nPastor Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Dallas is part of the president 's evangelical advisory group and says this gathering is of no consequence .\n`` It ’ s a meeting that will have very little impact on evangelicalism as a whole , '' Jeffress told ███ News . `` Many of them are sincere but they are having a hard time understanding that they have little impact on evangelicalism . ''\nREAD : Faith Inside the Oval Office : Evangelical Advisor Shares What It 's Like to Counsel Trump\nRichard Land of Southern Evangelical Seminary also questioned the weight of the meeting given the absence of some well-known names .\n`` Any definition of 'thought leaders ' and any definition of evangelicalism that excludes the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Franklin Graham is a pale imitation – anemic and incomplete , '' said Land .\nOther members of Trump ’ s faith advisory council spoke to ███ News off the record , one voicing his concern over what he sees as this group of evangelicals trying to steal the microphone from those who support Trump . He pointed to the fact that many invited to participate are part of the anti-Trump movement and hold more progressive views on public policy than traditional evangelical Christian voters who supported Trump in 2016 .\nJohnnie Moore , an unofficial spokesman for the faith advisory council , was among the many pro-Trump evangelicals not invited .\n`` We don ’ t take it personally ; we just pray for them , '' Moore said in a statement to ███ News . `` I ’ ve said it many , many times , but I ’ ll say it again : we have been honored to fight to protect religious liberty that even extends to protecting the rights of those who disagree with us on religious grounds , even when they are unkind . ''\nIn total , the meeting included about 50 faith leaders and scholars and was spearheaded by Doug Birdsall , Rev . Dr. Gabriel A. Salguero and Jenny Yang .\nMORE : 'Winning Power Was Judas 's Goal ' : These Christian Leaders Pitched Pre-Trump Unity , Now , Not So Much\nSalguero was appointed as a member of President Obama 's Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and has spoken at the Democrat National Committee Convention in the past .\nOther attendees included Timothy Keller , Mark Labberton and A.R .

But it became more than that.\n\nTwo sources with intimate knowledge of the meeting say the first day turned into a lot of \"one-sided venting\" against President Trump and the majority of evangelicals who voted for him.\n\nBoth sources confirm that the issue of sin came up in discussing how evangelicals could vote for Trump. \"The conversations were difficult,\" according to one source who attended both days of the meeting. \"There was a lament.\"\n\nAfter that first day, a few people felt so uncomfortable with the rhetoric against Trump they left, forgoing the last day of the conference.\n\nIt's important to note that no members of President Trump's faith advisory group were present or ever officially invited.\n\nRather, this group of evangelicals consisted of many who hold more moderate or progressive views on certain public policy issues.\n\nPastor Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Dallas is part of the president's evangelical advisory group and says this gathering is of no consequence.\n\n\"It’s a meeting that will have very little impact on evangelicalism as a whole,\" Jeffress told CBN News. \"Many of them are sincere but they are having a hard time understanding that they have little impact on evangelicalism.\"\n\nREAD: Faith Inside the Oval Office: Evangelical Advisor Shares What It's Like to Counsel Trump\n\nRichard Land of Southern Evangelical Seminary also questioned the weight of the meeting given the absence of some well-known names.\n\n\"Any definition of 'thought leaders' and any definition of evangelicalism that excludes the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Franklin Graham is a pale imitation – anemic and incomplete,\" said Land.\n\nOther members of Trump’s faith advisory council spoke to CBN News off the record, one voicing his concern over what he sees as this group of evangelicals trying to steal the microphone from those who support Trump. He pointed to the fact that many invited to participate are part of the anti-Trump movement and hold more progressive views on public policy than traditional evangelical Christian voters who supported Trump in 2016.\n\nJohnnie Moore, an unofficial spokesman for the faith advisory council, was among the many pro-Trump evangelicals not invited.\n\n\"We don’t take it personally; we just pray for them,\" Moore said in a statement to CBN News. \"I’ve said it many, many times, but I’ll say it again: we have been honored to fight to protect religious liberty that even extends to protecting the rights of those who disagree with us on religious grounds, even when they are unkind.\"\n\nIn total, the meeting included about 50 faith leaders and scholars and was spearheaded by Doug Birdsall, Rev. Dr. Gabriel A. Salguero and Jenny Yang.\n\nMORE: 'Winning Power Was Judas's Goal': These Christian Leaders Pitched Pre-Trump Unity, Now, Not So Much\n\nSalguero was appointed as a member of President Obama's Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and has spoken at the Democrat National Committee Convention in the past.\n\nOther attendees included Timothy Keller, Mark Labberton and A.R. Bernard who was once a Trump evangelical advisor.",

         "Six bullets . More than I can count on one hand . That is how many times preliminary autopsy reports indicate that Michael Brown was shot . Nothing about the youthful infraction of strolling down the middle of a residential street in one ’ s own neighborhood justifies having your life ripped away from you by an irate officer firing six bullets as you face him , hands up in surrender .\nI can not even fathom what Mike , “ Big Mike ” as his friends call him , felt as each of those bullets entered his flesh . I do know a little of the rage , despair , helplessness and hopelessness that black communities have been left to feel in the aftermath of his death . I know he stayed conscious long enough to put his hands up , to try and surrender , as if to say , “ I want to live . Please don ’ t kill me . ”\nFerguson residents and protesters now find themselves arms outstretched , palms up , yelling “ don ’ t shoot , ” as police officers in guns , gas masks and tanks occupy the streets of Ferguson , Missouri , dropping canisters of tear gas on our American dreams . Those of us not yet there in Ferguson watch helplessly as the images of at least one child being tear-gassed come through our Twitter feeds , as journalists find themselves facing down the barrel of a hastily drawn police weapon or thrown in jail , as police drop stun grenades on crowds that refuse to comply with the unreasonable demand that they relinquish their right to peaceful assembly .\nWhile the world watches aghast , America ’ s penchant for exporting guns , tanks and destruction to other places in the name of law and order has shown up on our own doorsteps , in our backyards , with people pinned into parking lots and onto their porches . They are told they must stay where they are or risk being shot with rubber bullets or have their faces and lungs sting with the inhalation of tear gas .\nPublic space in Ferguson is awash in black tears , but it is the sirens that we hear wailing . The people would weep , but they are too busy running , ducking and taking cover from the angry sounds of a system that does not love them , does not care about their meager “ rights . ”\nMeanwhile , the government attempts to placate the people with optical sleights of hand . Capt . Ron Johnson , by all accounts a sincere and affable leader and head of the highway patrol , replaced the police chief late last week , with promises that he would not employ military tactics to police the citizens of Ferguson . On Thursday I breathed a bit easier as we watched him giving hugs to protesters , marching with the people , allowing black women of faith to lay hands on him and pray .\nThat peace was short-lived after the Ferguson police inflamed crowds by releasing irrelevant footage of a conflict that Michael Brown had at a local convenience store when he and his friend Dorian went to buy Cigarellos . Late that evening the crowds returned , only to be met by more tanks , more tear gas , more guns .\nBeyond shock , I continue to be appalled at the extensive lengths to which the police have gone to protect Officer Darren Wilson and his family from any public reproach or reprisal in Mike ’ s death . They delayed the release of his name in order to provide him enough time to leave town . They then released his name to coincide with video of the Cigarello incident , which they later admitted he knew nothing about when he stopped Mike . It is clear that the police are closing ranks , showing that they value the lives of their own more than the lives of citizens .\nWe are told repeatedly that police are worthy of our respect because they risk their lives each day to protect us . That is not the case for black people . When we encounter police , our lives are at risk while they protect themselves . I started to temper my statement by saying “ some police , ” but that gives the impression that I am speaking of the actions of a few rogue officers . The problem with this logic is that we now know that Ferguson law enforcement has a range of problems – disproportionate stops of black residents , disproportionately low numbers of black police ( three out of over 50 ) , and a history of antagonistic exchanges with the people of St. Louis County .\nWe have a problem of overzealous policing in this country . That problem is exacerbated by issues of race and gender , so that black men are perceived to be far more threatening than they actually are . And when black women encounter police , we are not given the protections generally afforded to white femininity . Our womanhood does not mitigate the threat of police force . This , then , is not about the actions of a rogue officer , but rather about the ideology of overpolicing that deputizes extrajudicial behavior as completely justified , as long as the life being taken or haphazardly handled is a black or brown life . Though the killing of Brown by Wilson seemingly fits a long historical script of the harassment of black people at the hands of white police officers , the reality is that overpolicing is an ideology that many police officers subscribe to regardless of color .\nThat ideology is rooted in a kind of anti-blackness that sees black bodies as a perpetual and mortal threat . Anti-black rhetoric has shown up not only from the Ferguson police but also ironically in the reporting and advocacy of everyone from CNN reporter Don Lemon to rapper Nelly , in their continued focus on issues like “ black-on-black crime ” and the necessity of keeping law and order . “ Don ’ t use your last option , first , ” Nelly told folks on St. Louis radio . There is little recognition that it is Darren Wilson who used his last option – lethal force — first . Moreover , the whole point of using tear gas and military vehicles in this small community is to force the residents into a realization that they have run out of options . Sadly , anti-black ideology can emerge even from people who are black or who otherwise love black people .\nI know Americans like to see themselves as a law and order people , but the few folks who have rioted and looted over the last few days , many of whom are reportedly not Ferguson residents , were stopped in their tracks by peaceful protesters . Even still their presence exposes an inconvenient truth . The killing of unarmed teenagers by police officers is lawlessness . It shows a lack of respect for the sanctity of life and the rule of law . The supreme irony is seeing folks defend the officer ’ s lawlessness while calling for people destroying property to respect the law .\nAs I keep saying , destruction of property is not particularly productive . But I refuse to direct my ire toward anyone but the officer who unjustly took Michael Brown ’ s life and the police establishment that is now complicit in this crime .\nI am tired . Emotionally exhausted , actually . I am tired of going to sleep each night seeing a community of people who look like me under military siege . I ’ m tired of seeing crying black mothers – Sybrina Fulton , Lucia McBath and Leslie McSpadden —distraught over the loss of their teenage sons Trayvon , Jordan and Michael . I ’ m tired of hearing report after report of people under attack from tear gas . I ’ m tired of journalists being bullied for trying to tell the truth . I ’ m tired of explaining to white people why our anger is justified , why looting , which is a property crime , should not even be part of a conversation about the killing of a teenager , why the alleged shoplifting of cigarettes is not a capital offense , why the police officer who killed Mike for the crime of walking in the street is the real thug .\nWhite racism and white privilege continue a bad cop-good cop routine with black America that is utterly exhausting . Just when we think we are making headway , a well-meaning white person asks “ but can ’ t we condemn the looting too ? ” The question is : Have you condemned the killing ? Or have you tried to explain it away ? To justify it ?\nI will not engage in a condemnation quid pro quo with trolls , well-meaning white citizens or respectable black ones , “ Brand New Negroes ” I call them , in the tradition of the famous text from Harlem Renaissance philosopher Alain Locke . I will not concede that destruction of property is equal to the taking of life . I will not answer calls to be reasonable in the face of unreasonable , unjustifiable black death . I will not believe the lie that black propriety and respectability – pulling our pants up , speaking corporate English , never , ever doing anything wrong – will save us .\nFerguson exposes the extent to which American necropolitics shapes the terms and conditions of black life in what professor Sundiata Cha-Jua calls a new racial nadir . The first racial nadir happened from about 1890 to about 1930 , when black people experienced the unprecedented loss of political gains hard won in the aftermath of the Civil War and the astronomical rise of lynching . We have indeed reached a new nadir in America ’ s racial life , one hard to fathom as a black president sits in the White House , abdicating his responsibility to speak forcefully and forthrightly to the problem of racism and military-style policing both for fear of being seen as too “ black ” and for fear of political reprisal from the right .\nMeanwhile , our voting rights have been stripped away , our kids are being killed in the streets , their killers rarely convicted , and our communities are placed under siege . And our black president reminds us that `` there are young black men who commit crime , '' though he feels no responsibility to say this about any other race of people . It 's a shaming tactic that suggests that black people do not have the right to be angry when our communities are beset with so many problems . It is the kind of anti-black thinking that suggests `` acting respectably '' will save us .\nThese are scary times . They are times for rage . Time for telling the truth . Time for ripping the band-aids off our gaping wounds . Time to recognize that we can neither heal nor fix that which we will not confront .",

I will not believe the lie that black propriety and respectability – pulling our pants up, speaking corporate English, never, ever doing anything wrong – will save us.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nFerguson exposes the extent to which American necropolitics shapes the terms and conditions of black life in what professor Sundiata Cha-Jua calls a new racial nadir. The first racial nadir happened from about 1890 to about 1930, when black people experienced the unprecedented loss of political gains hard won in the aftermath of the Civil War and the astronomical rise of lynching. We have indeed reached a new nadir in America’s racial life, one hard to fathom as a black president sits in the White House, abdicating his responsibility to speak forcefully and forthrightly to the problem of racism and military-style policing both for fear of being seen as too “black” and for fear of political reprisal from the right.\n\nMeanwhile, our voting rights have been stripped away, our kids are being killed in the streets, their killers rarely convicted, and our communities are placed under siege. And our black president reminds us that \"there are young black men who commit crime,\" though he feels no responsibility to say this about any other race of people. It's a shaming tactic that suggests that black people do not have the right to be angry when our communities are beset with so many problems. It is the kind of anti-black thinking that suggests \"acting respectably\" will save us.\n\nThese are scary times. They are times for rage. Time for telling the truth. Time for ripping the band-aids off our gaping wounds. Time to recognize that we can neither heal nor fix that which we will not confront.",

         "In an extensive article published last month that included interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement officials , congressional officials and other government employees , the New York Times published a stinging indictment of James B. Comey ’ s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe .\nThe Times made the case that Comey violated FBI tradition , bypassed the Justice Department and went rogue on several occasions in a manner that clearly impacted the 2016 presidential election .\nIn a letter on Tuesday from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired , Rosenstein specifically cited Comey ’ s alleged mishandling of the Clinton email probe as justification for Comey ’ s removal from office .\n“ I can not defend the Director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of secretary Clinton ’ s emails , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ And I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken . Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes ; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives . ”\nRosenstein continued : “ The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General ’ s authority on July 5 , 2016 , and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution . It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement . At most , the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors . ”\nThat is precisely the case made by the Times ’ April 22 article , titled , “ Comey Tried to Shield the F.B.I . From Politics . Then He Shaped an Election . ”\nThe Times says that for its article it interviewed “ more than 30 current and former law enforcement , congressional and other government officials . ”\nThe newspaper concluded that Comey ’ s decision to inform Congress that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email probe less than two weeks before the presidential election “ violate [ ed ] the policies of an agency that does not reveal its investigations or do anything that may influence an election . ”\nThe article related that Comey decided to plunge the FBI “ into the molten center of a bitter election ” in part because he feared “ the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I . had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret . ”\nA significant motivating factor for Comey ’ s rogue approach toward the Clinton email probe , the Times revealed , was his distrust of senior officials at the Justice Department , especially then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch , whom , the newspaper reported , “ Mr . Comey believed had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation . ”\nIndeed , according to the Times , Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Hillary Clinton in the email probe .\nThe FBI had further information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence , leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the U.S. government ’ s Clinton email probe , the Times reported .\nIn his letter from Tuesday , Rosenstein argues that if Comey believed Lynch to be compromised he should have sought her recusal instead of taking matters into his own hands .\n“ The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Lynch had a conflict , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department . There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General . ”\nIndeed , according to the Times , after it became clear that the F.B.I . did not discover Clinton emails showing intent to mishandle classified information – the agency believed those emails were among the correspondence deleted by Clinton – Comey made the decision to bypass the Justice Department and explain the case to the public .\nNine months into the investigation , it became clear to Mr. Comey that Mrs. Clinton was almost certainly not going to face charges . He quietly began work on talking points , toying with the notion that in the midst of a bitter presidential campaign , a Justice Department led by Democrats may not have the credibility to close the case , and that he alone should explain that decision to the public .\nComey ’ s decision was further fueled by the alleged document written by a Democratic operative hacked by the Russians , a document that in Comey ’ s view raised “ questions about [ Lynch ’ s ] independence , ” the Times reported .\nInstead of seeking Lynch ’ s recusal , as Rosenstein would later outline as the proper course of action , Comey decided to go at it alone , take matters into his own hands and make his public pronouncements about Clinton ’ s email case without the Justice Department .\nThe Times cited former Justice officials as “ deeply skeptical ” of Comey ’ s alleged reasoning :\nFormer Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account . If Mr. Comey believed that Ms. Lynch were compromised , they say , why did he not seek her recusal ? Mr. Comey never raised this issue with Ms. Lynch or the deputy attorney general , Sally Q. Yates , former officials said .\nMr. Comey ’ s defenders regard this as one of the untold stories of the Clinton investigation , one they say helps explain his decision-making . But former Justice Department officials say the F.B.I . never uncovered evidence tying Ms. Lynch to the document ’ s author , and are convinced that Mr. Comey wanted an excuse to put himself in the spotlight .\nComey ’ s decision to go rogue was solidified , according to the Times ’ account , after Lynch ’ s infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton , the husband of the FBI ’ s main subject in a criminal probe , boarded the attorney general ’ s plane and reportedly stayed there for about twenty minutes .\nYet Comey still did not seek Lynch ’ s recusal . The Times article related that after the tarmac episode , Comey “ knew for sure that when there was something to say about the case , he alone would say it . ”\nAfterwards , Comey held the press conference at which he criticized Clinton ’ s private email server as “ extremely careless ” before finally stating that “ no charges are appropriate in this case . ”\nWith his pronouncements , Comey offered judgments and legal conclusions many argue are out of the purview of the FBI , which is charged with documenting the evidence and handing it over to the Justice Department .\nThe Times cited unnamed “ frustrated ” prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them .\nComey ’ s injection into the presidential race did not end there . Less than two weeks before the election , the FBI discovered a trove of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of long-time top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin . Some of the emails , according to reports , originated on Clinton ’ s old BlackBerry server that she used before setting up her private home server and some believe may have contained the deleted messages .\nComey ’ s decision centered on whether to follow FBI tradition and keep quiet about the reopening of the case , or inform Congress about the ongoing investigation , which , the Times related , “ everyone acknowledged would create a political furor . ”\nEventually , Comey decided to go rogue again and inform Congress .\nLynch was against the decision , the Times reported , and the Justice Department implored the FBI not to impact the presidential campaign in its final days . The Times reported that “ even at the F.B.I. , agents who supported their high-profile director were stunned . ”\n“ Career prosecutors and political appointees ” at the Justice Department quietly criticized not only Comey but Lynch for failing to stop the FBI director , the Times documented .\nA chorus of former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from across the political spectrum publicly criticized Comey ’ s move . For example , Jamie S. Gorelick , who served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration , opined that Comey was “ damaging our democracy . ”\nWriting in the Washington Post on October 29 , Gorelick slammed Comey ’ s decision to so publicly reopen the case just before the election as “ antithetical to the interests of justice , putting a thumb on the scale of this election and damaging our democracy . ”\nGorelick co-authored the Washington Post opinion piece , titled , “ James Comey is damaging our democracy , ” with Larry Thompson , who served under the George W. Bush administration as deputy attorney general from 2001 to 2003 .\nGorelick ’ s piece was referenced in Rosenstein ’ s letter on Tuesday recommending that Comey be fired , writing , “ I can not defend the director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton ’ s emails . ”\nRosenstein referenced the criticism of Comey from other former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general .\nFormer Attorney General Michael Mukasey , who served under President George W. Bush , observed that the Director stepped far outside his purview in disclosing the recommendation in that fashion “ because the FBI director doesn ’ t make that decision . ”\nAlberto Gonzales , who also served as Attorney General under President George W. Bush , called the decision an error in judgment .\nEric Holder , who served as Deputy Attorney General under President Clinton and Attorney General under President Obama , said that the Director ’ s decision “ was incorrect . It violated long-standing Justice Department policies and traditions. ” Holder concluded that the Director broke with these fundamental principles and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI .\nDonald Ayer , who served as Deputy Attorney General under President George H.W . Bush , along with other former Justice Department officials , was “ astonished and perplexed ” by the decision to “ break with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections . ”\nAaron Klein is Breitbart ’ s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter .

The Times reported that “even at the F.B.I., agents who supported their high-profile director were stunned.”\n\n“Career prosecutors and political appointees” at the Justice Department quietly criticized not only Comey but Lynch for failing to stop the FBI director, the Times documented.\n\nA chorus of former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from across the political spectrum publicly criticized Comey’s move. For example, Jamie S. Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration, opined that Comey was “damaging our democracy.”\n\nWriting in the Washington Post on October 29, Gorelick slammed Comey’s decision to so publicly reopen the case just before the election as “antithetical to the interests of justice, putting a thumb on the scale of this election and damaging our democracy.”\n\nGorelick co-authored the Washington Post opinion piece, titled, “James Comey is damaging our democracy,” with Larry Thompson, who served under the George W. Bush administration as deputy attorney general from 2001 to 2003.\n\nGorelick’s piece was referenced in Rosenstein’s letter on Tuesday recommending that Comey be fired, writing, “I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails.”\n\nRosenstein referenced the criticism of Comey from other former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general.\n\nBesides Gorelick’s Post piece, Rosenstein’s letter further outlined:\n\nFormer Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who served under President George W. Bush, observed that the Director stepped far outside his purview in disclosing the recommendation in that fashion “because the FBI director doesn’t make that decision.”\n\nAlberto Gonzales, who also served as Attorney General under President George W. Bush, called the decision an error in judgment.\n\nEric Holder, who served as Deputy Attorney General under President Clinton and Attorney General under President Obama, said that the Director’s decision “was incorrect. It violated long-standing Justice Department policies and traditions.” Holder concluded that the Director broke with these fundamental principles and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI.\n\nDonald Ayer, who served as Deputy Attorney General under President George H.W. Bush, along with other former Justice Department officials, was “astonished and perplexed” by the decision to “break with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections.”\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

         "“ Trump has betrayed the Syrian Kurds ” — so goes a popular refrain regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the areas of northeast Syria held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) . The events that have followed — namely , a Turkish invasion of parts of SDF territory along the border and the deployment of Syrian government forces in some SDF areas — have been characterized as a strategic disaster for American interests , with some commentators even proclaiming the withdrawal as indicative of a U.S. imperial decline and U.S. disengagement from the Middle East .\nIn fact , much of this is overblown . For one thing , the U.S. still maintains extensive troop deployments elsewhere in the Middle East , and those are not being drawn down anytime soon . Insofar as many of the pundits , analysts , and policymakers condemning Trump consider the recent developments in Syria to be a disaster , they primarily have themselves to blame , however popular bashing Trump might be .\nIndeed , these critics of Trump did not learn the relevant lessons from December 2018 when the president ordered preparations for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria . They should have appreciated that Trump is ultimately the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces and that he had made his own preferences on Syria clear : namely , that after the military defeat of the Islamic State , U.S. forces should leave . As the president ’ s record on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal illustrates , he has generally been forthright and sincere in trying to fulfill his policy promises . When he told his advisers that he wanted to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria , he meant it . The message should have been clear : devise an orderly withdrawal plan .\nBut that is not what happened . Instead , efforts and attention were geared towards U.S. forces remaining indefinitely in Syria . The advocates for this “ stay indefinitely ” approach argued that the deployment as it existed was supposedly an example of a successful projection of U.S. leverage and influence with a relatively small number of troops . They claimed that U.S. presence was vital for political negotiations on Syria ’ s future and important for limiting Iranian influence and blocking its “ land route ” to the Mediterranean .\nIn reality , none of these assertions holds up but rather reflect dubious expansions of the original purpose of the U.S. mission in Syria : countering the Islamic State . At the same time , the “ stay indefinitely ” crowd tended to downplay the major problem regarding the U.S. partnership with the SDF : the issue of relations with Turkey , which considers ( with some justification ) the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , which has fought the Turkish state for decades .\nRegardless of what one thinks of Turkey ’ s approach towards the PKK , it is not a problem that can be treated as a minor irritant . Facts of geography mean that Turkey is located along the northern borders of the SDF ’ s territory . As such , Turkey could be the SDF ’ s main gateway to the outside world , rather than the small and limited capacity border crossing on the Tigris River that the SDF has maintained with the Iraqi Kurdistan region . Thus , for the interests of the SDF ’ s longterm economic prospects ( among other things ) , some kind of détente or resolution of the conflict between the PKK and Turkey would have been necessary so that the region could have much more open borders and engagement with the outside world .\nUnfortunately , though , policymakers and advisers did not take Turkey ’ s concerns and its threats of a military confrontation with the SDF seriously enough . Along with their desire to keep U.S. troops in Syria , many of them imagined that Turkey could somehow be appeased through half-baked measures : thus the previous attempts to deny SDF–PKK links , the failed schemes of joint U.S.–Turkish patrols in the Manbij area west of the Euphrates River , and then the joint northern border patrols and partial dismantling of SDF fortifications along the northern border with Turkey a little while before the recent Turkish incursion against the SDF .\nOthers argue that the U.S. simply needed to be adamant in saying no to a Turkish incursion and that the small U.S. troop presence could have deterred Turkey indefinitely . This view is implausible . A small foreign troop presence can function as a deterrent to another side ’ s attack , but it is not an absolute deterrent here . To understand why , consider events that occurred earlier this year on the other side of Syria . In the northwest of Syria ( specifically the city of Idlib and its environs ) , Turkey set up multiple small military outposts in the insurgent-held areas ostensibly as part of enforcing a “ deescalation ” scheme in coordination with Russia . In practice , the goal has been to block any further Syrian government offensives on the northwest and prevent further refugee flows into Turkey .\nWhile Russia has shown some understanding of Turkey ’ s concerns in this regard , it also wishes to assist the Syrian government in restoring its control over the area and will not tolerate the indefinite presence of designated “ terrorist ” groups harassing Syrian government and Russian positions . Russia thus gave Turkey time to clear a demilitarized buffer zone of the likes of Hay ’ at Tahrir al-Sham ( a designated “ terrorist ” group ) . When that did not materialize and the insurgent harassments of Syrian government and Russian positions continued , the Syrian government and Russia launched a military campaign that retook important areas in south Idlib and north Hama . The Turkish military outposts did not do anything to stop the offensive ( indeed , they could not do so ) , and in effect the Syrian government and Russia worked around one of the outposts in north Hama . A ceasefire then followed , but it should be clear that it will not last if Turkey can not crack down on the groups that are designated as “ terrorist . ”\nThat episode should also have been a lesson for U.S. policymakers . Turkey ’ s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly said he would launch an incursion against the SDF to the east of the Euphrates River ( where U.S. forces in Syria have primarily been stationed ) , and in 2018 Turkey had carried through with its threats to destroy the SDF enclave in the Afrin area , where the U.S. had no presence . What would have stopped Turkey from finding ways to work around U.S. positions as part of its incursion against the SDF east of the Euphrates River and essentially forcing the small U.S. garrisons — confronted by much larger Turkish forces and their Syrian insurgent proxies — to get out of the way ?\nThus , Trump ’ s indication to Erdoğan that he wished to leave Syria and would not oppose an incursion likely hastened the Turkish operations against the SDF . But it was not the decisive factor in determining whether or not those operations would have eventually occurred anyway . Had the U.S. wished to deter Turkey indefinitely , it would have had to deploy far more troops in northeast Syria . For comparison , the much more extensive Turkish military presence in the insurgent-held north Aleppo countryside between Afrin and Jarabulus functions as an effective deterrent against Russian and Syrian government military action so long as Turkey maintains that large presence .\nOf course , the advocates of the “ stay indefinitely ” course did not dare to confront these realities and argue for a more extensive U.S. presence , knowing that such advocacy would be politically unacceptable . They preferred to argue that the small U.S. troop presence in northeast Syria as an example of a deployment that was strategically effective and inexpensive .\nUltimately , the debate about the U.S. role in Syria boils down to the question of how far the U.S. should invest troops and resources into a foreign deployment . Those who advocated an indefinite presence are delusional if they think the prior status quo was sustainable . If they had thought more carefully about the idea of making the SDF-held areas a U.S. protectorate that could function independently of the wider environment , they should have accepted that such a project would have required far more troops and money to be poured in .\nIn any case , they should still be asked why they did not come up with an exit plan but instead thought they could defy the president ’ s wishes . They are the ones far more deserving of the accusation of betrayal for making misleading commitments , promises , and reassurances to the SDF .",

If what's already out is all there is, Mr Kushner and his lawyers have done their best to defuse the bombs. When walking in a minefield, it's the ones you don't know about that pose the greatest risk.\n\nOne matter on which Mr Kushner may face a grilling is his security clearance declaration, as he accepts he failed initially to reveal his contacts with Russians.\n\nHe says the first form, a \"rough draft that still had many omissions\", was filed by an assistant in error on 18 January and that declarations on his foreign contacts, not just with Russians, were added over the next six months \"in the normal course\".\n\nMr Kushner on his meetings with Russians:\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nAmbassador Sergei Kislyak ( above ).

         "Jim Acosta of CNN and other media personalities get exercised when the President calls Fake News the “ enemy of the people. ” President Trump does not call all news outlets or personalities by that term — only the Fake News . Certainly , that term is quite an incendiary sobriquet . The President reciprocates with it because he gets attacked with incendiary abuse . No American President in memory has been picked on and lied about with the intensity and frequency that President Trump has had to endure .\nThe media — because it is almost-monolithically Left-Democrat — regularly depicted Ronald Reagan as a moron , occasionally tying him to a movie in which he acted , Bedtime for Bonzo , where he went to bed in one scene alongside a chimpanzee . ( They forget that he was cast in the film as a university professor . ) Reagan endured it , avoided reciprocal name-calling , and history unequivocally has registered that he actually was quite brilliant , understood what so many others could not grasp , revived the moribund Jimmy Carter economy with creative strategies and tax-cutting boldness that George H.W . Bush myopically had called “ Voodoo Economics , ” stared down Mikhail Gorbachev and defeated a century of Communism , and launched an anti-ballistic military focus that his enemies mocked as “ Star Wars ” but that today is central to protecting Western democracies from incoming ballistic missiles . The “ Iron Dome ” missile-defense system that Israel has used so effectively against Gaza Hamas terrorist rockets is the fruit of “ Star Wars . ”\nThe Left Media almost universally depicted the brilliant Reagan as an idiot , and he somehow shrugged it off . Donald Trump is different because we do not manufacture our Presidents with interchangeable parts on an assembly line . It very well may be that the past week ’ s Pittsburgh terrorist attack , and the way the President responded , and the way the Left Media then hit the President viciously anyway is the “ Rosetta Stone ” — the small piece of archaeological evidence historians will need — to decipher that Donald Trump was right to call the Fake News Left Media the “ enemy of the people . ”\n1 . “ The People ” Benefit From a Robust and Independent Press — and a Fake News Regime Indeed Is the Enemy of the People\n“ The People ” indeed benefit from a robust “ press ” — more accurately called “ media ” in this digital age of televised news , digital internet-based news , and so much more than the mere newsprint “ press. ” If Stalin ’ s Soviet Russia had been covered by a robust media ( and if such media could have survived ) , “ The People ” would have learned that Stalin ’ s five-year economic plans disastrously were failing and were leading to mass starvation , moreover that he consciously was perpetrating genocide by starving millions of Ukrainians to death in the Golodomor , that he was putting millions of prisoners to work in tundra prisons to dig through ice manually to build canals and other infrastructure . An honest news media would have alerted the West , too , that Stalin was murdering millions . The New York Times had a sycophantically pro-Stalin liar , Walter Duranty , filing Fake News reports from the Soviet Union for more than ten years . The Times published the lies daily as “ news ” and made him their Moscow bureau chief for fourteen years . As a result , the West was lulled , cheated of the truth , made unaware of the evil . Yes , the Fake News indeed was the enemy of the people .\nLikewise , the New York Times— and the other mainstream media who took their lead from them — by and large refused to report on the unfolding Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews . Between 1939 and 1945 , the New York Times published more than 23,000 front-page stories . Of those , 11,500 were about World War II . Only twenty-six — in six years — were about the Holocaust . The Times was passively complicit .\nA robust newsmedia can save lives by exposing and revealing , while a Fake News regime can serve to assist in the despoiling of a people . When media foist false narratives to sow social discord , or when they assist tyranny with falsehoods , they indeed are the enemy of the people .\nSocial discord leads to streets being set on fire — witness Ferguson and Baltimore during the Obama Years . Social discord dispirits potentially valuable citizens who could help build a society , instead turning them against that society and motivating them to work towards its downfall or simply to drop out . In its worst aspect , social discord leads to armed insurrection and civil war . If the problem is that a Stalin is murdering millions by deliberately starving them while incarcerating millions others in slave camps in the Gulag , then insurrection and civil war can be righteous , potentially saving such a despoiled society . But when the society actually is doing quite well , when freedom reigns and people of all colors , creeds , religions , and ethnicities are enjoying remarkable opportunities to succeed and to live wonderfully rich and precious lives alongside their neighbors in respectful diversity , then Fake News media indeed are the enemy of the people when they seek to sow social discord in that welcome environment , aiming to up-end civil harmony .\nA maniacal dirtbag murdered eleven Jews in Pittsburgh . In time , perhaps after a decade or two of ACLU appeals , he will be electrocuted , injected , hanged , or hopefully all three . The dirtbag hated Jews , and he likewise hated President Trump . President Trump responded to the news immediately with profoundly sensitive and healing words aimed at condemning anti-Semitism and at comforting and consoling the Jewish community . Listen to his words . If the role of a President is to heal and unify , as President Reagan did after the Challenger tragedy , as President Bush did after 9-11 , then this President did so eloquently , sensitively . And then came the sowers of social discord to destroy the moment… .\nThe Left Media would not allow the President that moment to heal and unify . Instantly , they brought in one Left-Democrat anti-Trump “ analyst ” after another to blame Mr. Trump for the attack . They never blamed President Jimmy Carter ’ s anti-Jewish rhetoric for the 1977 Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue shooting in St. Louis . Nor Bill Clinton for the 1994 Brooklyn Bridge shootings of yeshiva students that included the murder of Ari Halberstam . Nor Clinton ’ s rhetoric for the 1999 Granada Hills Jewish Community Center shooting in Los Angeles . Nor Obama for the deadly 2009 Holocaust Museum shooting in Washington , D.C . Nor Obama for the 2014 Overland Park Jewish Community Center shootings in Kansas City that murdered three . But this time — with the same social dynamics as the others — they tried blaming the President . By sowing social discord with outright absolute falsehoods at a time that called for healing , the Left Media indeed were acting as enemy of the people .\nFacts are different from opinions . Facts can be discerned and evidenced . There is a reason that as many as 82 percent of Israeli Jews love President Trump , that more than 90 percent of American Orthodox Jews support President Trump . Likewise , a huge majority of British Jews — by more than three-to-one — support England ’ s conservative party and despise the Labour Socialists . Similarly , millions of Jews who have left the former Soviet Union hate Marxism and socialism , are solidly capitalist and conservative , indeed have changed the face of Israeli politics towards the more conservative Likud , now led by Benjamin Netanyahu . Throughout the world , Jews now vote conservative , are conservative — as reflected in our country , too , by American Orthodox Jews . The independent Pew Research Center has found that the Orthodox Jewish community will be the predominant Jewish community in a few decades , as the others disappear . Just as the voting patterns of the American Deep South have changed 180 degrees from Democrat to Republican in the century since the Civil War , so is the American Jewish metamorphosis now on pace to synchronize with every other Jewish community in the world that has moved towards conservatism . But Jews are not monolithic , as witness those in Hollywood and in certain media .\nSo look at what the Fake News Left Media did after President Trump healed and unified : They received a news release from a small , utterly insignificant , nothing of a Radical Leftist group , calling itself “ Bend the Arc , ” which said that they did not want the President of the United States to visit Pittsburgh . The thing is , those Radical Leftists do not want the President to visit anywhere . Just as there are rabid Leftist Catholics ( not to mention the more mainstream Leftist Nancy Pelosi , Joe Biden , and the Kennedys ) and rabid Leftist Protestants , these also are rabid Leftists . Within the normative mainstream American Jewish community , “ Bend the Arc ” is a joke , off the charts . Their CEO started off as a sex-club “ dancer. ” C ’ mon ! As reported : “ Cotler , who identifies as queer , recounted how a lesbian couple invited her to their [ event ] after she did a table dance for them at what she refers to as a ‘ sex club. ’ ” Feh !\nSo this Leftist fringe group issues their statement — and the Fake News Left Media then falsely report that “ the Jews of Pittsburgh ” ( not “ some Jews ” ) do not want the President to visit . Consider these headlines — and they are a mere sampling :\n“ ‘ You Are Not Welcome ’ : Jewish Community Leaders Do Not Want President Trump To Come To Pittsburgh ” ( Salon )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Stay Away Unless He Denounces White Nationalism ” ( NY Daily News )\n“ Trump ‘ Not Welcome ’ In Pittsburgh After Synagogue Shooting ” ( Al Jazeera )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Denounce White Nationalism ” ( Reuters )\nAll those stories thereupon cite the same insignificant radical-fringe “ Bend the Arc ” statement . Honestly — if there still is such a thing as honesty — that is outright Fake News . I know the American Jewish community . I have been a Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America , a congregational rabbi for decades , sat for six years during this past decade on the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America , have sat on committees of Jewish Federations and Boards of Hillels , have a whole lifetime résumé in this area . My rabbinical colleagues and I were bristling all day , reading and hearing this Fake News . The rabbi of the temple where the murders happened , Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers , explicitly welcomed a visit by the President . To report such lies , at a time of such intense passion , is to stoke flames among the populace . It is not unfair to call such liars “ Enemies of the People . ”\nThey do it similarly to convince Americans of Color that this President hates them . He beams so proudly that he has helped reduce poverty and unemployment in the African-American community . Likewise , in the Latino and Greater Hispanic communities . It is a hallmark of his every speech . How compare him to Hitler , for G-d ’ s sakes ? Why sow social discord between and among races when the President , despite his classical Trumpian gaffes , actually takes so much pride in his being a President for all Americans , in a country where — in his trademark line — “ we all bleed the same red , white , and blue ” ? Why denigrate his outreach to Black Americans , whether via Kanye West and Jim Brown or by speaking to a Young Black Leadership Summit ? Why begin narrating his Presidency on Day One by reporting falsely , as Zeke Miller of Time magazine did , the lie that he had removed a bust of the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office ? Why publish falsehoods to sow discord among the Black and Latino communities — if not to aim cynically to peel away their votes — by trying falsely to report that he is a bigot who hates them ? Here is a man who was in the public eye , in the world ’ s media center in the heart of Manhattan , with a weekly network television show , building skyscrapers and hotels , golf courses and casinos — all bearing his name — and no stain of racism or bigotry of such sort ever got attached to him through all those decades in the limelight . Why cause enmity and divide the nation , disillusion African Americans and Latinos from recognizing that this President seeks their advancement alongside that of everyone else ? Only to sow civil discord , to promote tension and unrest in the name of advancing an agenda that assures greater television ratings , higher advertising dollars , and a change in the elected government chosen of The People , by The People , and for The People .\n3 . The Proof the Pudding : Tagging the Most Pro-Jewish President in American History as an Anti-Semite .\nSo it comes back to the Rosetta Stone — the way the Left Media falsely portrays this President ’ s relationship with one demographic , the Jews , demonstrating a pattern of Left Media mendacity aimed at sowing social discord throughout . Even before he was elected President , the Left Media was calling him an anti-Semite by clutching at straws to prove the false narrative . Just as they did by propping up “ Bend the Arc ” into a Fake News depiction as “ Jewish Leaders , ” they regularly dig up the most irrelevant and unrepresentative people from the Far Left who are JINOs— Jews In Name Only — as “ experts ” on Trump and anti-Semitism . It does not end . These are lies , damned lies , and more damned lies being perpetuated by enemies of the people . Just consider these facts about the Trump Administration and the Jews :\nThis is an anti-Semite ? If so , may G-d smite us with an abundance of such anti-Semites ! Although his daughter , Ivanka , and son-in-law Jared Kushner are Orthodox Jews — as are their children , his grandchildren — that family connection in itself is not determinative . After all , we are told that George Soros is a Jew , and most every Jew I know would gladly trade Soros for two anti-Semites and a neo-Nazi to be named later . Soros is a major opponent of Israel and secretly funds organizations that oppose critical Israel policies . But the demonstrated life record of President Trump , a lifetime of working closely with Jews , amicably and warmly , makes him someone whom Jews throughout the world appreciate deeply . Again — every survey and poll of Jews who actually live the Jewish observances , the kosher laws , the Sabbath , the Torah demonstrates that he is warmly regarded in that community .\nThe Fake News about Trump and Jews is the Rosetta Stone . Once one cracks that hidden code , everything else becomes clear . The Left Media indeed propound Fake News , lies , and falsehoods . They undertake to stoke anger among African Americans , among Latinos , among women . The People rely on them for the news , the truth — and , yes , for honest reporting when the President is wrong because The People benefit when they are told the truth , even when the truth is not pretty . But to depict him as an agent of Putin , as a man perpetrating treason , a hater ?\nThese are the lies that come only from Enemies of the People .",
         "Jim Acosta of CNN and other media personalities get exercised when the President calls Fake News the “enemy of the people.” President Trump does not call all news outlets or personalities by that term — only the Fake News. Certainly, that term is quite an incendiary sobriquet. The President reciprocates with it because he gets attacked with incendiary abuse. No American President in memory has been picked on and lied about with the intensity and frequency that President Trump has had to endure.\n\nThe media — because it is almost-monolithically Left-Democrat — regularly depicted Ronald Reagan as a moron, occasionally tying him to a movie in which he acted, Bedtime for Bonzo, where he went to bed in one scene alongside a chimpanzee. (They forget that he was cast in the film as a university professor.) Reagan endured it, avoided reciprocal name-calling, and history unequivocally has registered that he actually was quite brilliant, understood what so many others could not grasp, revived the moribund Jimmy Carter economy with creative strategies and tax-cutting boldness that George H.W. Bush myopically had called “Voodoo Economics,” stared down Mikhail Gorbachev and defeated a century of Communism, and launched an anti-ballistic military focus that his enemies mocked as “Star Wars” but that today is central to protecting Western democracies from incoming ballistic missiles. The “Iron Dome” missile-defense system that Israel has used so effectively against Gaza Hamas terrorist rockets is the fruit of “Star Wars.”\n\nThe Left Media almost universally depicted the brilliant Reagan as an idiot, and he somehow shrugged it off. Donald Trump is different because we do not manufacture our Presidents with interchangeable parts on an assembly line. It very well may be that the past week’s Pittsburgh terrorist attack, and the way the President responded, and the way the Left Media then hit the President viciously anyway is the “Rosetta Stone” — the small piece of archaeological evidence historians will need — to decipher that Donald Trump was right to call the Fake News Left Media the “enemy of the people.”\n\n1. “The People” Benefit From a Robust and Independent Press — and a Fake News Regime Indeed Is the Enemy of the People\n\n“The People” indeed benefit from a robust “press” — more accurately called “media” in this digital age of televised news, digital internet-based news, and so much more than the mere newsprint “press.” If Stalin’s Soviet Russia had been covered by a robust media (and if such media could have survived), “The People” would have learned that Stalin’s five-year economic plans disastrously were failing and were leading to mass starvation, moreover that he consciously was perpetrating genocide by starving millions of Ukrainians to death in the Golodomor, that he was putting millions of prisoners to work in tundra prisons to dig through ice manually to build canals and other infrastructure. An honest news media would have alerted the West, too, that Stalin was murdering millions. The New York Times had a sycophantically pro-Stalin liar, Walter Duranty, filing Fake News reports from the Soviet Union for more than ten years. The Times published the lies daily as “news” and made him their Moscow bureau chief for fourteen years. As a result, the West was lulled, cheated of the truth, made unaware of the evil. Yes, the Fake News indeed was the enemy of the people.\n\nLikewise, the New York Times— and the other mainstream media who took their lead from them — by and large refused to report on the unfolding Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews. Between 1939 and 1945, the New York Times published more than 23,000 front-page stories. Of those, 11,500 were about World War II. Only twenty-six — in six years — were about the Holocaust. The Times was passively complicit.\n\nA robust newsmedia can save lives by exposing and revealing, while a Fake News regime can serve to assist in the despoiling of a people. When media foist false narratives to sow social discord, or when they assist tyranny with falsehoods, they indeed are the enemy of the people.\n\nSocial discord leads to streets being set on fire — witness Ferguson and Baltimore during the Obama Years. Social discord dispirits potentially valuable citizens who could help build a society, instead turning them against that society and motivating them to work towards its downfall or simply to drop out. In its worst aspect, social discord leads to armed insurrection and civil war. If the problem is that a Stalin is murdering millions by deliberately starving them while incarcerating millions others in slave camps in the Gulag, then insurrection and civil war can be righteous, potentially saving such a despoiled society. But when the society actually is doing quite well, when freedom reigns and people of all colors, creeds, religions, and ethnicities are enjoying remarkable opportunities to succeed and to live wonderfully rich and precious lives alongside their neighbors in respectful diversity, then Fake News media indeed are the enemy of the people when they seek to sow social discord in that welcome environment, aiming to up-end civil harmony.\n\n2. Pittsburgh: The Rosetta Stone\n\nA maniacal dirtbag murdered eleven Jews in Pittsburgh. In time, perhaps after a decade or two of ACLU appeals, he will be electrocuted, injected, hanged, or hopefully all three. The dirtbag hated Jews, and he likewise hated President Trump. President Trump responded to the news immediately with profoundly sensitive and healing words aimed at condemning anti-Semitism and at comforting and consoling the Jewish community. Listen to his words. If the role of a President is to heal and unify, as President Reagan did after the Challenger tragedy, as President Bush did after 9-11, then this President did so eloquently, sensitively. And then came the sowers of social discord to destroy the moment….\n\nThe Left Media would not allow the President that moment to heal and unify. Instantly, they brought in one Left-Democrat anti-Trump “analyst” after another to blame Mr. Trump for the attack. They never blamed President Jimmy Carter’s anti-Jewish rhetoric for the 1977 Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue shooting in St. Louis. Nor Bill Clinton for the 1994 Brooklyn Bridge shootings of yeshiva students that included the murder of Ari Halberstam. Nor Clinton’s rhetoric for the 1999 Granada Hills Jewish Community Center shooting in Los Angeles. Nor Obama for the deadly 2009 Holocaust Museum shooting in Washington, D.C. Nor Obama for the 2014 Overland Park Jewish Community Center shootings in Kansas City that murdered three. But this time — with the same social dynamics as the others — they tried blaming the President. By sowing social discord with outright absolute falsehoods at a time that called for healing, the Left Media indeed were acting as enemy of the people.\n\nFacts are different from opinions. Facts can be discerned and evidenced. There is a reason that as many as 82 percent of Israeli Jews love President Trump, that more than 90 percent of American Orthodox Jews support President Trump. Likewise, a huge majority of British Jews — by more than three-to-one — support England’s conservative party and despise the Labour Socialists. Similarly, millions of Jews who have left the former Soviet Union hate Marxism and socialism, are solidly capitalist and conservative, indeed have changed the face of Israeli politics towards the more conservative Likud, now led by Benjamin Netanyahu. Throughout the world, Jews now vote conservative, are conservative — as reflected in our country, too, by American Orthodox Jews. The independent Pew Research Center has found that the Orthodox Jewish community will be the predominant Jewish community in a few decades, as the others disappear. Just as the voting patterns of the American Deep South have changed 180 degrees from Democrat to Republican in the century since the Civil War, so is the American Jewish metamorphosis now on pace to synchronize with every other Jewish community in the world that has moved towards conservatism. But Jews are not monolithic, as witness those in Hollywood and in certain media.\n\nSo look at what the Fake News Left Media did after President Trump healed and unified: They received a news release from a small, utterly insignificant, nothing of a Radical Leftist group, calling itself “Bend the Arc,” which said that they did not want the President of the United States to visit Pittsburgh. The thing is, those Radical Leftists do not want the President to visit anywhere. Just as there are rabid Leftist Catholics (not to mention the more mainstream Leftist Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, and the Kennedys) and rabid Leftist Protestants, these also are rabid Leftists. Within the normative mainstream American Jewish community, “Bend the Arc” is a joke, off the charts. Their CEO started off as a sex-club “dancer.” C’mon! As reported: “Cotler, who identifies as queer, recounted how a lesbian couple invited her to their [event] after she did a table dance for them at what she refers to as a ‘sex club.’” Feh!\n\nSo this Leftist fringe group issues their statement — and the Fake News Left Media then falsely report that “the Jews of Pittsburgh” (not “some Jews”) do not want the President to visit. Consider these headlines — and they are a mere sampling:\n\n“‘You Are Not Welcome’: Jewish Community Leaders Do Not Want President Trump To Come To Pittsburgh” (Salon)\n\n“Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Stay Away Unless He Denounces White Nationalism” (NY Daily News)\n\n“Trump ‘Not Welcome’ In Pittsburgh After Synagogue Shooting” (Al Jazeera)\n\n“Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Denounce White Nationalism” (Reuters)\n\nAll those stories thereupon cite the same insignificant radical-fringe “Bend the Arc” statement. Honestly — if there still is such a thing as honesty — that is outright Fake News. I know the American Jewish community. I have been a Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America, a congregational rabbi for decades, sat for six years during this past decade on the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America, have sat on committees of Jewish Federations and Boards of Hillels, have a whole lifetime résumé in this area. My rabbinical colleagues and I were bristling all day, reading and hearing this Fake News. The rabbi of the temple where the murders happened, Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers, explicitly welcomed a visit by the President. To report such lies, at a time of such intense passion, is to stoke flames among the populace. It is not unfair to call such liars “Enemies of the People.”\n\nThey do it similarly to convince Americans of Color that this President hates them. He beams so proudly that he has helped reduce poverty and unemployment in the African-American community. Likewise, in the Latino and Greater Hispanic communities. It is a hallmark of his every speech. How compare him to Hitler, for G-d’s sakes? Why sow social discord between and among races when the President, despite his classical Trumpian gaffes, actually takes so much pride in his being a President for all Americans, in a country where — in his trademark line — “we all bleed the same red, white, and blue”? Why denigrate his outreach to Black Americans, whether via Kanye West and Jim Brown or by speaking to a Young Black Leadership Summit? Why begin narrating his Presidency on Day One by reporting falsely, as Zeke Miller of Time magazine did, the lie that he had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office? Why publish falsehoods to sow discord among the Black and Latino communities — if not to aim cynically to peel away their votes — by trying falsely to report that he is a bigot who hates them? Here is a man who was in the public eye, in the world’s media center in the heart of Manhattan, with a weekly network television show, building skyscrapers and hotels, golf courses and casinos — all bearing his name — and no stain of racism or bigotry of such sort ever got attached to him through all those decades in the limelight. Why cause enmity and divide the nation, disillusion African Americans and Latinos from recognizing that this President seeks their advancement alongside that of everyone else? Only to sow civil discord, to promote tension and unrest in the name of advancing an agenda that assures greater television ratings, higher advertising dollars, and a change in the elected government chosen of The People, by The People, and for The People.\n\n3. The Proof the Pudding: Tagging the Most Pro-Jewish President in American History as an Anti-Semite.\n\nSo it comes back to the Rosetta Stone — the way the Left Media falsely portrays this President’s relationship with one demographic, the Jews, demonstrating a pattern of Left Media mendacity aimed at sowing social discord throughout.

They undertake to stoke anger among African Americans, among Latinos, among women.

But to depict him as an agent of Putin, as a man perpetrating treason, a hater?\n\nThese are the lies that come only from Enemies of the People.",

         "ALEXANDRIA , Va. ( ███ ) - Rick Gates , a longtime business associate of U.S. President Donald Trump ’ s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort , on Monday testified that he helped Manafort file false tax returns and hide his foreign bank accounts .\nGates is the government ’ s star witness in its case against Manafort , who is accused of bank and tax fraud . Gates , who also served on Trump ’ s campaign , pleaded guilty in February and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors under a deal that could lead to a reduced sentence .\nTaking the stand on the trial ’ s fifth day , Gates admitted to helping Manafort doctor financial statements , hide foreign income and cheat on his taxes . He said he was aware Manafort was acting as an unregistered foreign agent in lobbying for Ukraine . He said he engaged in the wrongdoing at Manafort ’ s direction .\n“ At Mr. Manafort ’ s request we did not disclose foreign bank accounts , ” Gates told the jury in federal court in Alexandria , Virginia .\nManafort ’ s defense hinges on pinning the blame on Gates , who they accuse of embezzling millions of dollars from Manafort .\nGates , who first met Manafort working for him as an intern fresh out of college , has been described by witnesses as Manafort ’ s right-hand man in his multimillion-dollar political consulting business .\nThroughout his testimony , Gates largely avoided making eye contact with Manafort , who appeared to be watching him .\nIn addition to assisting in Manafort ’ s alleged crimes , Gates told the jury he had failed to report income he routed through his bank accounts in the United Kingdom and said he stole several hundreds of thousands of dollars from Manafort by filing false and inflated expense reports .\nThose admissions are likely to become a focal point for Manafort ’ s defense team when he is cross examined on Tuesday .\nManafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts . The charges largely predate his five months on the Trump campaign . His case is the first to go to trial arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election .\nThe jury has heard how Manafort made tens of millions of dollars for work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine . Mueller is also investigating possible coordination between Trump campaign members and Russian officials in the election campaign , but the charges against Manafort do not address that .\nFormer Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort is shown in a court room sketch , during a testimony of a longtime business associate Rick Gates ( not shown ) , on the fifth day of his trial , on bank and tax fraud charges stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , in federal court in Alexandria , Virginia , U.S. , August 6 , 2018 . Judge T.S .

         "ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - Rick Gates, a longtime business associate of U.S. President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, on Monday testified that he helped Manafort file false tax returns and hide his foreign bank accounts.\n\nGates is the government’s star witness in its case against Manafort, who is accused of bank and tax fraud. Gates, who also served on Trump’s campaign, pleaded guilty in February and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors under a deal that could lead to a reduced sentence.\n\nTaking the stand on the trial’s fifth day, Gates admitted to helping Manafort doctor financial statements, hide foreign income and cheat on his taxes. He said he was aware Manafort was acting as an unregistered foreign agent in lobbying for Ukraine. He said he engaged in the wrongdoing at Manafort’s direction.\n\n“At Mr. Manafort’s request we did not disclose foreign bank accounts,” Gates told the jury in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nManafort’s defense hinges on pinning the blame on Gates, who they accuse of embezzling millions of dollars from Manafort.\n\nGates, who first met Manafort working for him as an intern fresh out of college, has been described by witnesses as Manafort’s right-hand man in his multimillion-dollar political consulting business.\n\nThroughout his testimony, Gates largely avoided making eye contact with Manafort, who appeared to be watching him.\n\nIn addition to assisting in Manafort’s alleged crimes, Gates told the jury he had failed to report income he routed through his bank accounts in the United Kingdom and said he stole several hundreds of thousands of dollars from Manafort by filing false and inflated expense reports.\n\nThose admissions are likely to become a focal point for Manafort’s defense team when he is cross examined on Tuesday.\n\nManafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. The charges largely predate his five months on the Trump campaign. His case is the first to go to trial arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nThe jury has heard how Manafort made tens of millions of dollars for work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Mueller is also investigating possible coordination between Trump campaign members and Russian officials in the election campaign, but the charges against Manafort do not address that.\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort is shown in a court room sketch, during a testimony of a longtime business associate Rick Gates (not shown), on the fifth day of his trial, on bank and tax fraud charges stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, U.S., August 6, 2018.

         "Last week , Creshuna Miles , Juror No . 8 in the Michael Dunn trial , gave an interview to CNN about the jury ’ s partial verdict . Although she believes that Michael Dunn is guilty of second-degree murder , a lesser charge for which the jury had the option to convict , she insisted that the case was “ not about race , ” that it never came up . Moreover , she believed Michael Dunn to be essentially “ a good guy , ” who made “ bad choices . ”\nStartlingly , she also indicated that until Dunn ran down the street chasing Jordan ’ s three friends , she actually believed that Dunn acted in self-defense .\nPost-racial thinking is insidious not only because it gives lie to the very real and continuing material consequences of racism in this country , but also because it seduces young , optimistic , idealistic black youth into identifying with the very systems and people who would kill them without a second thought -- and then go order a pizza and a take a nap .\nPart of what Miles ’ impressions of Dunn reveal is that the defense did a far better job of humanizing Dunn for the jury than the prosecution did of humanizing Jordan for the jury .\nBut her impressions also reveal a deep disidentification with the seemingly retrograde racial politics that informed Dunn ’ s fatal engagement with Jordan Davis . Those 20th century-style racial politics take as a given that a group of young black men listening to rap music must be up to no good and that white harm is imminent .\nSuch thinking seems not to fit the cosmopolitan , progressive 21st century narrative of multiracial acceptance that ideological post-racialism pretends to be .\nI know that jury selection is a strategy . And I know Creshuna Miles was picked because she is a black woman whose political views seem to be able to lay race to the side , even when it is so glaringly obvious .\nHad Jordan Davis been white , he would still be alive . Maybe Michael Dunn would have yelled at a white Jordan Davis for bumping rap music , but he absolutely would not have perceived such a kid to be a threat or the playing of rap music loud enough to constitute a capital offense .\nCreshuna Miles came to a right decision , and wanted to convict Michael Dunn of some form of murder . But her fervent belief that the case was “ about justice , ” not “ about race , ” misses a fundamental truth about American society . Justice and injustice in this country are inextricable from racial politics . Racial politics determine everything from who gets arrested to who gets convicted , the harshness of the sentences they ’ ll serve , and the quality of legal representation they ’ ll have .\nMoreover , Creshuna Miles is not just a black woman . She is a big , dark-skinned black woman , who rocks honey blond highlights in her hair . Her unmistakable , inescapable , culturally ethnic blackness is part of the unspoken but visual narrative of this trial . Just as Michael Dunn came upon a car and visually assessed threat based upon the color of the young men inside , the visuality of Creshuna Miles ’ body absolutely influences how her testimony is understood .\nIn some ways Miles is a perfect foil for Rachel Jeantel . In Jeantel ’ s post-Zimmerman trial interview , she discounted a juror who claimed race hadn ’ t mattered in the trial , telling Piers Morgan , “ Let ’ s be honest . It ’ s racial. ” In this case , Creshuna Miles , just one year older than and visually similar to Rachel , comes along and says just the opposite . In both cases , black America saw the bodies of these two women and cringed . Internalized self-hatred coupled with violent conditions for black men is always a dangerous brew for black women . So I have been less compelled to jump on the `` critique Creshuna '' bandwagon , because so much of it is rooted in the unreasonable expectations that we have for black women to know how to outwit a system that is designed to work against not just black men , but us , too . Still I see Rachel and Creshuna and a certain knowing emerges for me .\nI know that when you live your life in an unmistakably big black body , of the type that Rachel , Creshuna and I share , a body that is often seen as aggressive and threatening , two types of coping strategies emerge . One is a kind of aggressive embrace of one ’ s own blackness and a refusal to take any shit . That seems like how Rachel rolls . The other relies on a rejection of the truth about race as a form of triumph over the impenetrability of racial discourse . In other words , maybe Creshuna Miles felt more intelligent and progressive , by taking a contrarian position , by not holding the views that people assumed that she , as a black person , would hold .\nGiven her particular kind of black embodiment , Creshuna Miles ’ decision carries great weight in an American populace that deeply wants to believe in the myth of a colorblind system . The problem here – the lie of post-racialism , to be more precise – is that Miles ’ rejection of the racial elements of this case hold more weight precisely because she is a black woman . Essentially , finding the biggest and blackest of black women to say that there was no miscarriage of justice in this case helps assuage any white guilt .\nI ’ m not angry with Creshuna Miles . But I know her thinking , uninformed as it is , is dangerous . I know the justice system relies on the willing racial performativity of black people who are willing to discount the importance of race in matters such as these . Much like patriarchy requires the complicity and willing participation of women to continue , racism requires the complicity and willing , if unwitting , participation of black and people of color to continue .\nI ’ m deeply bothered by the fact that she does not seemingly understand the way in which her body was used against her . That she felt compelled as a black woman in the case to come out and insist on all the ways that it wasn ’ t about race suggests how deeply it is about race . Florida ’ s justice system pimped Creshuna Miles for her body type and flawed perspective . Her identification with Dunn is the flip side of the same kind of logic that got Trayvon and Jordan killed . She failed to recognize that she was on the jury and appealing to the media precisely because she reads as everything Dunn is not . She might see the justice system as colorblind , but it absolutely would not see her in the same ways . Everyone sees her color . By the same token , Trayvon , Jordan , Rachel and even Marcus Smart all believed they could engage white people who approached them combatively on equal or similar terms .\nWhen Zimmerman confronted and questioned Trayvon , Trayvon talked back and then fought back . When the Zimmerman defense team goaded Rachel Jeantel on the stand , she served up a healthy helping of visible disdain . When Michael Dunn confronted Jordan and his friends , they all verbally resisted his “ instruction ” and command that they turn down the music .\nThese young black folks have not fully reckoned with what it means to occupy a completely different social position than the white people who confronted them and demanded various forms of compliance . One set of social positions has legal protection and the right to armed self-defense . The other social position requires deference and the eschewing of all aggression in order to be believed and protected – and in order to stay among the living .\nJordan , Trayvon and Rachel never perfected the fine art of respectable resistance . And because I am deeply resistant to respectability politics on principle , I ’ m not sure they should . But the death and tragedy these young people have endured reminds me of why our ancestors frequently turned to respectable forms of resistance as a form of survival .\nWhen I look at Creshuna Miles , it is clear to me that her racial analysis is far more akin to that of her peers than different . All of these young people want to believe that they have the right to assert themselves and their rights and priorities in the same ways that white men retain the prerogative to do . Through the most brutal of lessons , they continue to learn differently .\nI hope Creshuna Miles learns differently . I remind myself that she is only 21 and that she did vote to convict . But racial innocence won ’ t serve her well . I hope she knows that she was chosen as a juror because of the combination of her black body and her whitewashed racial views , not despite them . And I hope time gently rather than harshly teaches her that post-racialism won ’ t protect her from her own blackness any more than it protected Jordan .",

Those 20th century-style racial politics take as a given that a group of young black men listening to rap music must be up to no good and that white harm is imminent.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSuch thinking seems not to fit the cosmopolitan, progressive 21st century narrative of multiracial acceptance that ideological post-racialism pretends to be.\n\nI know that jury selection is a strategy. And I know Creshuna Miles was picked because she is a black woman whose political views seem to be able to lay race to the side, even when it is so glaringly obvious.\n\nHad Jordan Davis been white, he would still be alive. Maybe Michael Dunn would have yelled at a white Jordan Davis for bumping rap music, but he absolutely would not have perceived such a kid to be a threat or the playing of rap music loud enough to constitute a capital offense.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nCreshuna Miles came to a right decision, and wanted to convict Michael Dunn of some form of murder. But her fervent belief that the case was “about justice,” not “about race,” misses a fundamental truth about American society. Justice and injustice in this country are inextricable from racial politics. Racial politics determine everything from who gets arrested to who gets convicted, the harshness of the sentences they’ll serve, and the quality of legal representation they’ll have.\n\nMoreover, Creshuna Miles is not just a black woman. She is a big, dark-skinned black woman, who rocks honey blond highlights in her hair. Her unmistakable, inescapable, culturally ethnic blackness is part of the unspoken but visual narrative of this trial. Just as Michael Dunn came upon a car and visually assessed threat based upon the color of the young men inside, the visuality of Creshuna Miles’ body absolutely influences how her testimony is understood.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIn some ways Miles is a perfect foil for Rachel Jeantel. In Jeantel’s post-Zimmerman trial interview, she discounted a juror who claimed race hadn’t mattered in the trial, telling Piers Morgan, “Let’s be honest. It’s racial.” In this case, Creshuna Miles, just one year older than and visually similar to Rachel, comes along and says just the opposite. In both cases, black America saw the bodies of these two women and cringed. Internalized self-hatred coupled with violent conditions for black men is always a dangerous brew for black women. So I have been less compelled to jump on the \"critique Creshuna\" bandwagon, because so much of it is rooted in the unreasonable expectations that we have for black women to know how to outwit a system that is designed to work against not just black men, but us, too. Still I see Rachel and Creshuna and a certain knowing emerges for me.\n\nI know that when you live your life in an unmistakably big black body, of the type that Rachel, Creshuna and I share, a body that is often seen as aggressive and threatening, two types of coping strategies emerge. One is a kind of aggressive embrace of one’s own blackness and a refusal to take any shit. That seems like how Rachel rolls. The other relies on a rejection of the truth about race as a form of triumph over the impenetrability of racial discourse. In other words, maybe Creshuna Miles felt more intelligent and progressive, by taking a contrarian position, by not holding the views that people assumed that she, as a black person, would hold.\n\nGiven her particular kind of black embodiment, Creshuna Miles’ decision carries great weight in an American populace that deeply wants to believe in the myth of a colorblind system. The problem here – the lie of post-racialism, to be more precise – is that Miles’ rejection of the racial elements of this case hold more weight precisely because she is a black woman. Essentially, finding the biggest and blackest of black women to say that there was no miscarriage of justice in this case helps assuage any white guilt.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI’m not angry with Creshuna Miles. But I know her thinking, uninformed as it is, is dangerous. I know the justice system relies on the willing racial performativity of black people who are willing to discount the importance of race in matters such as these. Much like patriarchy requires the complicity and willing participation of women to continue, racism requires the complicity and willing, if unwitting, participation of black and people of color to continue.\n\nI’m deeply bothered by the fact that she does not seemingly understand the way in which her body was used against her. That she felt compelled as a black woman in the case to come out and insist on all the ways that it wasn’t about race suggests how deeply it is about race. Florida’s justice system pimped Creshuna Miles for her body type and flawed perspective. Her identification with Dunn is the flip side of the same kind of logic that got Trayvon and Jordan killed. She failed to recognize that she was on the jury and appealing to the media precisely because she reads as everything Dunn is not. She might see the justice system as colorblind, but it absolutely would not see her in the same ways. Everyone sees her color. By the same token, Trayvon, Jordan, Rachel and even Marcus Smart all believed they could engage white people who approached them combatively on equal or similar terms.\n\nWhen Zimmerman confronted and questioned Trayvon, Trayvon talked back and then fought back. When the Zimmerman defense team goaded Rachel Jeantel on the stand, she served up a healthy helping of visible disdain. When Michael Dunn confronted Jordan and his friends, they all verbally resisted his “instruction” and command that they turn down the music.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThese young black folks have not fully reckoned with what it means to occupy a completely different social position than the white people who confronted them and demanded various forms of compliance. One set of social positions has legal protection and the right to armed self-defense. The other social position requires deference and the eschewing of all aggression in order to be believed and protected – and in order to stay among the living.\n\nJordan, Trayvon and Rachel never perfected the fine art of respectable resistance. And because I am deeply resistant to respectability politics on principle, I’m not sure they should. But the death and tragedy these young people have endured reminds me of why our ancestors frequently turned to respectable forms of resistance as a form of survival.\n\nWhen I look at Creshuna Miles, it is clear to me that her racial analysis is far more akin to that of her peers than different. All of these young people want to believe that they have the right to assert themselves and their rights and priorities in the same ways that white men retain the prerogative to do. Through the most brutal of lessons, they continue to learn differently.\n\nI hope Creshuna Miles learns differently. I remind myself that she is only 21 and that she did vote to convict. But racial innocence won’t serve her well. I hope she knows that she was chosen as a juror because of the combination of her black body and her whitewashed racial views, not despite them. And I hope time gently rather than harshly teaches her that post-racialism won’t protect her from her own blackness any more than it protected Jordan.",

         "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on , though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question . So now , in order to preserve the broader framework — in which , for example , that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order , and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley .\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position , and the temporizing of others around her , I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done . There is still fierce opposition in some nearby quarters to what she has done , and she showed some degree of moral leadership when she called for state law to be quickly changed , so that the battle flag could be taken down . Yet , it ’ s equally clear that she has framed her argument well within the historical tradition of Southern white supremacist ideology — not in the heart of that tradition , to be sure , but still within the stifling folds of its garments .\nFor many people in our state the flag stands for traditions that are noble — traditions of history , of heritage , and of ancestry . The hate-filled murderer who massacred our brothers and sisters in Charleston has a sick and twisted view of the flag . In no way does he reflect the people in our state who respect and in many ways revere it . Those South Carolinians view the flag as a symbol of respect , integrity and duty . They also see it as a memorial , a way to honor ancestors who came to the service of their state during time of conflict . That is not hate . Nor is it racism .\nIn short , Dylann Roof messed things up for all the rest of us , so — unfortunately — things have to change . Implicitly , that ’ s the real bottom line . Haley continued , with a brief nod to the obvious , before hurrying on :\nAt the same time , for many others in South Carolina , the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past . As a state , we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints . We do not need to declare a winner and a loser here .\nAnd so she declared a truce — the truce of false equivalency — as the pathway forward :\nWe respect freedom of expression . And that for those who wish to show their respect for the flag on their private property , no one will stand in your way . But the statehouse is different . And the events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way .\nThe willingness to change is easy to grab onto and praise , but the more troubling aspects , the multiple ways in which change — not to mention simple justice — are more challenging to properly grasp , identify and name , much less come to terms with . At least three starting points can easily be identified , however . The first came from Ta-Nehisi Coates . Honing in on the underlying claim that Roof 's views did not reflect those of South Carolinians more broadly , Coates quickly weighed in to say :\nIf the governor meant that very few of the flag ’ s supporters believe in mass murder , she is surely right . But on the question of whose view of the Confederate Flag is more twisted , she is almost certainly wrong . Roof ’ s belief that black life had no purpose beyond subjugation is “ sick and twisted ” in the exact same manner as the beliefs of those who created the Confederate flag were “ sick and twisted. ” The Confederate flag is directly tied to the Confederate cause , and the Confederate cause was white supremacy .\nThis is the plain historical reality , and Coates goes on to rolls out stanza after stanza in an impressive historical litany of authoritative voices repeatedly underscoring the point , beginning with the Confederate states ’ own explanations for war , starting with South Carolina , then Mississippi ( which was particularly blunt : “ Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world. ” ) , Louisiana , Alabama ( “ the election of Mr. Lincoln can not be regarded otherwise than … an open declaration of war ” ) and Texas .\nHe then goes on to quote notable individuals , such as Jefferson Davis , not only affirming the centrality of slavery to the Southern cause , but elaborating on their desire to extend slaveholding into Cuba , Mexico and elsewhere , as well as propounding their belief that the equality of white men was founded on the slavery of blacks , and thus would be irrevocably lost if slavery were to be abolished . Thus , white supremacy for the South was not simply an isolated belief in the inherent superiority of whites as a race , it was the foundation for an aggressive and self-styled “ progressive ” worldview , a whole self-contained system of thought . The flag is inextricably linked to all of that .\nAs a second starting point it ’ s also true that the Confederate battle flag was largely a relic until it was revived in response to the Civil Rights Movement — first with Strom Thurmond ’ s “ States Rights Party ” in 1948 , then with Georgia adopting a version in protest of Brown v. Board of Education in 1956 , and South Carolina six years later — though , tellingly , the flag went up a year before the act authorizing it . For almost a hundred years , the South got on just fine celebrating its heritage without benefit of the flag . Indeed , the flag was raised over South Carolina as a result of the Civil War centennial celebration . This revival of interest in the flag was clearly all about renewed defiance of the federal government , which was finally being prodded into making good on the Civil War Amendments , and ensuring the full citizenship of African-Americans . Hence , today , the “ heritage ” the flag actually stands for is that of the 1960s , not the 1860s . Good luck with that .\nA third , related point , made by Jeet Heer at the New Republic , is that the flag matters tremendously as exertion of raw power . Its reintroduction in response to the Civil Rights movement sent a clear message : “ The feds might try to help you , but remember who is the boss down here . We still rule. ” Flying everywhere throughout the South , it sends the constant message to black Southerners , that they are not safe , they are not in control of their own personal security , much less anything else . Whatever other stories Southern whites might tell themselves and others about the flag , this basic fact remains . Indeed , the rhetorical act of denying the flag ’ s white supremacist meaning only demonstrates further how completely whites control things .\nBeyond these three starting points , there ’ s a vast terrain to explore , in terms of the white supremacist legacy the flag stands for and how it has reshaped itself over time . There are at least four key elements that any such account would have to explore . First , is the matter of white supremacy itself as a matter of organized social policy — both in terms of what it supports ( slavery in one era , segregation in the next , etc . ) and what it opposes ( abolition , integration , “ big government ” ) — as well as the culture it both depends upon and reproduces . Second , is the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to another , both establishing purportedly new foundations , while simultaneously reinterpreting the past .\nIt originally expressed itself in terms of slavery , then segregation and now largely in terms of what sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva described as “ colorblind racism ” in his book `` Racism Without Racists : Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America . '' Third , is the way in which white supremacy naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against . Bonilla-Silva ’ s book has a great deal to say about this as well . Furthermore , the pretense that the battle flag represents Civil War-era heritage rather than Civil Rights-era hatred is a telling example of how this process unfolds . Fourth , is the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance , etc . Haley leaned very heavily on this aspect of white supremacy in the process of pretending to reject it . So let us briefly consider each of these in turn .\nFirst , let ’ s reflect on white supremacy as a matter of organized social policy . There is nothing particularly difficult for people today to look back on past forms of white supremacy and reject them . It ’ s easy nowadays to see slavery or segregation as evil . Even Rand Paul , defending segregation in principle , said it was a bad business decision . But what about white supremacy policies today ?\nWhile part of the impetus to remove the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina came from respect for the Rev . Clementa Pinckney , the long-serving , highly respected member of the South Carolina State Senate , this only scratched the surface of Pinckney ’ s politics , as pointed out by North Carolina NAACP leader the Rev . William Barber on Democracy Now ! recently :\nReverend Pinckney , as a colleague in ministry , was not just opposed to the flag , he was opposed to the denial of Medicaid expansion , where now the majority of the state is opposing Medicaid expansion where six out of 10 black people live . He was opposed to voter suppression , voter ID in South Carolina . He was opposed to those who have celebrated the ending of the Voting Rights Act , or the gutting of Section 4 , which means South Carolina is no longer a preclearance state , and the very district that he served in is vulnerable right now . He was opposed to the lack of funding for public education . He wanted to see living wages raised .\nEvery item Barber mentioned is felt more deeply by the black community , so it ’ s not hard to grasp what a true rejection of white supremacy would look like . One might say that this calls for “ activist government , ” but the white South was all in favor of activist government `` When Affirmative Action Was White , '' as Ira Katznelson ’ s 2006 book explained . Thus , Barber continued :\nSo I would say to my colleagues , let ’ s take down the flag — to the governor — but also , let ’ s put together an omnibus bill in the name of the nine martyrs . And all of the things Reverend Pinckney was standing for , if we say we love him and his colleagues , let ’ s put all of those things in a one big omnibus bill and pass that and bring it to the funeral on Friday or Saturday , saying we will expand Medicaid to help not only black people , but poor white Southerners in South Carolina , because it ’ s not just the flag . Lee Atwater talked about the Southern strategy , where policy was used as a way to divide us . And if we want harmony , we have to talk about racism , not just in terms of symbol , but in the substance of policies . The flag went up to fight policies . If we ’ re going to bring it down , we ’ re also going to have to change policies , and particularly policies that create disparate impact on black , brown and poor white people .\nThe phrase “ disparate impact , ” which Barber used , is key to how white supremacy operates in the post-segregation era . It ’ s not that the races are treated entirely differently , only that the odds , burdens , privileges and benefits change , depending on the color of your skin . Often this happens without any conscious awareness , which is why Bonilla-Silva ’ s phrase , “ racism without racists ” is so apt . This is really not difficult to grasp — unless you ’ ve got a vested interest in not grasping it . In which case , welcome to the world of our second topic , the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to the next , and how\nTransitions between eras are often abrupt in some respects — the swift abolition of slavery in the final years of the Civil War , for example — while taking decades to work out in other ways . In order to first establish , and then fully stabilize the segregationist era , the meaning and purpose of the Civil War itself had to be reinterpreted through a white supremacist lens . The story of how that transpired over a fifty-year period is the subject of `` Race and Reunion : The Civil War in American Memory '' by David W. Blight . As I summarized in my review :\nBlight explains three broad visions of Civil War memory - reconciliationist , emancipationist and white supremacist . The first was born in wartime responses to its terrible brutality , epitomized by Walt Whitman 's experience of tending the wounded and dying of both sides . The second sprang not just from the war , but also from the Emancipation Proclamation and the more than 200,000 black combatants who joined the fight . The third gradually reformulated itself after the shock of military defeat , eventually dominating reconciliationist thinking by sacrificing racial reconciliation for the sake of sectional reunion .\nIt was not surprising that the reconciliationist view came to dominate — politically , materially , the nation needed sectional reintegration in a much more immediate way than it needed anything for its black citizens — a calculus that would eventually change over time . What ’ s striking is the relative ease with which the white supremacist vision came to merge with and dominate the reconciliationist view .\nThis is not the exception , but the rule in American history : any moves toward reconciling differences inevitably become infected with white supremacist aims — unless , of course , they are founded on them to begin with , as the case with American Colonization Society and the movement surrounding it , more on that below . A similar process has taken place with the end of segregation and the discrediting of overt racism which the norm in that era throughout the South , as well as in much of the North . This is essence of what Bonilla-Silva reveals in `` Racism Without Racists '' : a set of beliefs has emerged with superficially broad appeal , but which harbors a “ hidden ” white supremacist impact . Bonilla-Silva identifies four central frames at the core of colorblind racism : `` The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information , '' Bonilla-Silva writes . The first — and what I take to be the most significant and distinctive frame — is “ abstract liberalism , ” which he explains as follows :\nThe frame of abstract liberalism involves using ideas associated with political liberalism ( e.g . `` equal opportunity , '' the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy ) and economic liberalism ( e.g. , choice , individualism ) in an abstract manner to explain racial matters .\nWhat abstract liberalism hides is virtually everything having to do with history and indeed all social science , outside the narrow framework of market economics . It hides all historical inequalities , which recent research suggests persists for as long as ten generations . It also hides subconscious racial preferences , which can create intense segregation without any overt centralized coercion . But above all , it creates the illusion of some idealized social order , which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “ reverse racism. ” In short , the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them : they are the “ real racists , ” not whites !\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles , but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone . These are “ naturalization , ” which “ allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences , ” “ cultural racism ” which “ relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘ Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education ’ or ‘ blacks have too many babies ’ to explain the standing of minorities in society ” and “ minimization of racism ” which “ suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities ' life chances ( ‘ It 's better now than in the past ’ or ‘ There is discrimination , but there are plenty of jobs out there ’ ) . ” All three of these frames have been used in past eras . For example , Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past , so segregation was something blacks could and should accept . Similarly , cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism . But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today .\nAs I indicated above , not only does Bonilla-Silva ’ s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another , it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “ naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against. ” Indeed , this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “ common sense ” emerges , responding to multiple different needs at once , most typically , a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible , and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible . The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude , even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact . Meanwhile , those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order , even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics .\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic , the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance and so forth . It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else , and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done . Not only does white supremacy lay down the law , if conflicts arise in response , white supremacy takes the lead in naming , identifying and analyzing them , leading to proposed white supremacist solutions . On a macro scale , this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale , from the lowliest parts on up to the whole .\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society . It was originally founded to bring together two politically disparate groups , Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders , both united by the belief that free blacks faced a miserable future in America , and would be better off in Africa . This granddaddy of all “ grand bargains ” was laughable on its face — there hundreds of thousands of free blacks , far more than could ever be returned to Africa , even if they had all wanted to go — which most emphatically did not . But it was extremely popular with political elites , precisely because of its centrist power to “ bring people together ” — white people , that is . In his book , `` Of One Blood : Abolitionism and the Origins of Racial Equality , '' historian Paul Goodman had this to say :\nBy 1817 , African colonization had become more than a speculative idea . In the next decade , hundreds of prominent Americans -- political leaders including Presidents Madison and Monroe and religious leaders in most of the large denominations , from Presbyterian Lyman Beecher of Massachusetts to Episcopalian bishop William Mead of Virginia—threw their prestige and influence behind the America Colonization Society ( ACS ) , which established the colony of Liberia in West Africa . One of the most impressive voluntary societies of its day , the ACS boasted over two hundred state and local auxiliaries by 1830 . It was quietly assisted by President Monroe and endorsed by state legislatures and the major religious denominations , as well as by an illustrious panoply of notables .\nAs Goodman goes on to describe , the 19th-Century abolitionist movement was born out of free blacks ’ opposition to the ACS . It was precisely their unwillingness to be “ reasonable ” which formed the foundation of resistance which eventually spread to white abolitionists , and over a period five decades , eventually resulted in emancipation . Yet , almost up until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation he himself continued to be a supporter of colonization — such was the power of this “ centrist ” white supremacist vision . In fact , the ACS lived on for almost 100 years after Lincoln ’ s death — it only shut down in 1964 !\nThere are many other instances in which the cause of black freedom only advanced by refusing to be “ reasonable ” or to live up to some purported virtue or another . That ’ s because white supremacy , in one form or another , has always had such an enormous say in dictating what it meant to be “ reasonable ” or virtuous . And so it ’ s been incumbent on blacks to learn to think outside the box — to find a broader framework of understanding on which to found their moral as well as their political analysis .\nThis is why Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , once spoke to the American Psychological Association , and came out proudly for the cause of what he called “ creative maladjustment ” :\nI am sure that we will recognize that there are some things in our society , some things in our world , to which we should never be adjusted . There are some things concerning which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will . We must never adjust ourselves to racial discrimination and racial segregation . We must never adjust ourselves to religious bigotry . We must never adjust ourselves to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few . We must never adjust ourselves to the madness of militarism , and the self-defeating effects of physical violence… . Thus , it may well be that our world is in dire need of a new organization , The International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment .\nSimilarly , King ’ s “ Letter From Birmingham Jail ” was all about rejecting the framework of passive , superficial words of peace , moderation and restraint which the white ministers of Birmingham sought to impose on him . Here is just a small section of the wisdom it contains :\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress . I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace , in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight , to a substantive and positive peace , in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality . Actually , we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension . We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive . We bring it out in the open , where it can be seen and dealt with .\nI could not help myself thinking about the profound wrong-headed of “ reasonable ” white supremacy as I heard Nikki Haley ’ s speech , which is why my enthusiasm for it was so dimmed . In perhaps her most deeply typical move , she said there didn ’ t have to be winners and losers . Folks who love the flag and folks who despise it can all get along just fine ! But , of course , that leaves the entire substantive agenda Reverend Barber spoke about dead on arrival — just as it was supposed to do . There is no real underlying intent to address and disown the evil of white supremacy . The only way that evil is faced is by projecting it onto the disowned Confederate son , Dylann Roof .\nA good way to understand what ’ s wrong with Haley ’ s speech is to compare it with a speech by a quintessential white Southerner , Strom Thurmond ’ s son , whose speech makes no such attempt to defend the blind worship of “ heritage. ” Here is what South Carolina State Senator Paul Thurmond said :\nI am aware of my heritage . But my appreciation for the things that my forebearers accomplished to make my life better doesn ’ t mean that I must believe that they always made the right decisions and , for the life of me , I will never understand how anyone could fight a civil war based , in part , on the desire to continue the practice of slavery . Think about it for just a second . Our ancestors were literally fighting to continue to keep human beings as slaves and continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will . I am not proud of this heritage . These practices were inhumane and were wrong , wrong , wrong .\nWhere Haley felt the need to comfort — even identify with — those who see the flag as a symbol of noble heritage , Paul Thurmond simply said , “ I am not proud. ” Simple as that . A clean break . And that , my friends , is what America needs , where white supremacy is concerned . A clean break — and then the real business of a creating a livable future for all of us can begin .",
         "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on, though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question. So now, in order to preserve the broader framework — in which, for example, that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order, and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.\n\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position, and the temporizing of others around her, I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done.

Haley continued, with a brief nod to the obvious, before hurrying on:\n\nAt the same time, for many others in South Carolina, the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past. As a state, we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints.

At least three starting points can easily be identified, however. The first came from Ta-Nehisi Coates. Honing in on the underlying claim that Roof's views did not reflect those of South Carolinians more broadly, Coates quickly weighed in to say:\n\nIf the governor meant that very few of the flag’s supporters believe in mass murder, she is surely right. But on the question of whose view of the Confederate Flag is more twisted, she is almost certainly wrong. Roof’s belief that black life had no purpose beyond subjugation is “sick and twisted” in the exact same manner as the beliefs of those who created the Confederate flag were “sick and twisted.” The Confederate flag is directly tied to the Confederate cause, and the Confederate cause was white supremacy.\n\nThis is the plain historical reality, and Coates goes on to rolls out stanza after stanza in an impressive historical litany of authoritative voices repeatedly underscoring the point, beginning with the Confederate states’ own explanations for war, starting with South Carolina, then Mississippi (which was particularly blunt: “Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world.”), Louisiana, Alabama (“the election of Mr. Lincoln cannot be regarded otherwise than … an open declaration of war”) and Texas.\n\nHe then goes on to quote notable individuals, such as Jefferson Davis, not only affirming the centrality of slavery to the Southern cause, but elaborating on their desire to extend slaveholding into Cuba, Mexico and elsewhere, as well as propounding their belief that the equality of white men was founded on the slavery of blacks, and thus would be irrevocably lost if slavery were to be abolished. Thus, white supremacy for the South was not simply an isolated belief in the inherent superiority of whites as a race, it was the foundation for an aggressive and self-styled “progressive” worldview, a whole self-contained system of thought. The flag is inextricably linked to all of that.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAs a second starting point it’s also true that the Confederate battle flag was largely a relic until it was revived in response to the Civil Rights Movement — first with Strom Thurmond’s “States Rights Party” in 1948, then with Georgia adopting a version in protest of Brown v. Board of Education in 1956, and South Carolina six years later — though, tellingly, the flag went up a year before the act authorizing it. For almost a hundred years, the South got on just fine celebrating its heritage without benefit of the flag. Indeed, the flag was raised over South Carolina as a result of the Civil War centennial celebration. This revival of interest in the flag was clearly all about renewed defiance of the federal government, which was finally being prodded into making good on the Civil War Amendments, and ensuring the full citizenship of African-Americans. Hence, today, the “heritage” the flag actually stands for is that of the 1960s, not the 1860s. Good luck with that.\n\nA third, related point, made by Jeet Heer at the New Republic, is that the flag matters tremendously as exertion of raw power. Its reintroduction in response to the Civil Rights movement sent a clear message: “The feds might try to help you, but remember who is the boss down here. We still rule.” Flying everywhere throughout the South, it sends the constant message to black Southerners, that they are not safe, they are not in control of their own personal security, much less anything else. Whatever other stories Southern whites might tell themselves and others about the flag, this basic fact remains. Indeed, the rhetorical act of denying the flag’s white supremacist meaning only demonstrates further how completely whites control things.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBeyond these three starting points, there’s a vast terrain to explore, in terms of the white supremacist legacy the flag stands for and how it has reshaped itself over time. There are at least four key elements that any such account would have to explore. First, is the matter of white supremacy itself as a matter of organized social policy — both in terms of what it supports (slavery in one era, segregation in the next, etc.) and what it opposes (abolition, integration, “big government”) — as well as the culture it both depends upon and reproduces. Second, is the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to another, both establishing purportedly new foundations, while simultaneously reinterpreting the past.\n\nIt originally expressed itself in terms of slavery, then segregation and now largely in terms of what sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva described as “colorblind racism” in his book \"Racism Without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America.\" Third, is the way in which white supremacy naturalizes, normalizes and moralizes itself, so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify, much less name, and fight against. Bonilla-Silva’s book has a great deal to say about this as well. Furthermore, the pretense that the battle flag represents Civil War-era heritage rather than Civil Rights-era hatred is a telling example of how this process unfolds. Fourth, is the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals, such bringing people together, establishing peace and harmony, promoting tolerance, etc. Haley leaned very heavily on this aspect of white supremacy in the process of pretending to reject it. So let us briefly consider each of these in turn.\n\nFirst, let’s reflect on white supremacy as a matter of organized social policy. There is nothing particularly difficult for people today to look back on past forms of white supremacy and reject them. It’s easy nowadays to see slavery or segregation as evil. Even Rand Paul, defending segregation in principle, said it was a bad business decision. But what about white supremacy policies today?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhile part of the impetus to remove the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina came from respect for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the long-serving, highly respected member of the South Carolina State Senate, this only scratched the surface of Pinckney’s politics, as pointed out by North Carolina NAACP leader the Rev. William Barber on Democracy Now! recently:\n\nReverend Pinckney, as a colleague in ministry, was not just opposed to the flag, he was opposed to the denial of Medicaid expansion, where now the majority of the state is opposing Medicaid expansion where six out of 10 black people live. He was opposed to voter suppression, voter ID in South Carolina. He was opposed to those who have celebrated the ending of the Voting Rights Act, or the gutting of Section 4, which means South Carolina is no longer a preclearance state, and the very district that he served in is vulnerable right now. He was opposed to the lack of funding for public education. He wanted to see living wages raised.\n\nEvery item Barber mentioned is felt more deeply by the black community, so it’s not hard to grasp what a true rejection of white supremacy would look like. One might say that this calls for “activist government,” but the white South was all in favor of activist government \"When Affirmative Action Was White,\" as Ira Katznelson’s 2006 book explained. Thus, Barber continued:\n\nSo I would say to my colleagues, let’s take down the flag — to the governor — but also, let’s put together an omnibus bill in the name of the nine martyrs. And all of the things Reverend Pinckney was standing for, if we say we love him and his colleagues, let’s put all of those things in a one big omnibus bill and pass that and bring it to the funeral on Friday or Saturday, saying we will expand Medicaid to help not only black people, but poor white Southerners in South Carolina, because it’s not just the flag. Lee Atwater talked about the Southern strategy, where policy was used as a way to divide us. And if we want harmony, we have to talk about racism, not just in terms of symbol, but in the substance of policies. The flag went up to fight policies. If we’re going to bring it down, we’re also going to have to change policies, and particularly policies that create disparate impact on black, brown and poor white people.\n\nThe phrase “disparate impact,” which Barber used, is key to how white supremacy operates in the post-segregation era. It’s not that the races are treated entirely differently, only that the odds, burdens, privileges and benefits change, depending on the color of your skin. Often this happens without any conscious awareness, which is why Bonilla-Silva’s phrase, “racism without racists” is so apt. This is really not difficult to grasp — unless you’ve got a vested interest in not grasping it. In which case, welcome to the world of our second topic, the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to the next, and how\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTransitions between eras are often abrupt in some respects — the swift abolition of slavery in the final years of the Civil War, for example — while taking decades to work out in other ways. In order to first establish, and then fully stabilize the segregationist era, the meaning and purpose of the Civil War itself had to be reinterpreted through a white supremacist lens. The story of how that transpired over a fifty-year period is the subject of \"Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory\" by David W. Blight. As I summarized in my review:\n\nBlight explains three broad visions of Civil War memory - reconciliationist, emancipationist and white supremacist. The first was born in wartime responses to its terrible brutality, epitomized by Walt Whitman's experience of tending the wounded and dying of both sides. The second sprang not just from the war, but also from the Emancipation Proclamation and the more than 200,000 black combatants who joined the fight. The third gradually reformulated itself after the shock of military defeat, eventually dominating reconciliationist thinking by sacrificing racial reconciliation for the sake of sectional reunion.\n\nIt was not surprising that the reconciliationist view came to dominate — politically, materially, the nation needed sectional reintegration in a much more immediate way than it needed anything for its black citizens — a calculus that would eventually change over time. What’s striking is the relative ease with which the white supremacist vision came to merge with and dominate the reconciliationist view.\n\nThis is not the exception, but the rule in American history: any moves toward reconciling differences inevitably become infected with white supremacist aims — unless, of course, they are founded on them to begin with, as the case with American Colonization Society and the movement surrounding it, more on that below. A similar process has taken place with the end of segregation and the discrediting of overt racism which the norm in that era throughout the South, as well as in much of the North. This is essence of what Bonilla-Silva reveals in \"Racism Without Racists\": a set of beliefs has emerged with superficially broad appeal, but which harbors a “hidden” white supremacist impact. Bonilla-Silva identifies four central frames at the core of colorblind racism: \"The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information,\" Bonilla-Silva writes. The first — and what I take to be the most significant and distinctive frame — is “abstract liberalism,” which he explains as follows:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe frame of abstract liberalism involves using ideas associated with political liberalism (e.g. \"equal opportunity,\" the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy) and economic liberalism (e.g., choice, individualism) in an abstract manner to explain racial matters.\n\nWhat abstract liberalism hides is virtually everything having to do with history and indeed all social science, outside the narrow framework of market economics. It hides all historical inequalities, which recent research suggests persists for as long as ten generations. It also hides subconscious racial preferences, which can create intense segregation without any overt centralized coercion. But above all, it creates the illusion of some idealized social order, which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “reverse racism.” In short, the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them: they are the “real racists,” not whites!\n\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles, but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone. These are “naturalization,” which “allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences,” “cultural racism” which “relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education’ or ‘blacks have too many babies’ to explain the standing of minorities in society” and “minimization of racism” which “suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities' life chances (‘It's better now than in the past’ or ‘There is discrimination, but there are plenty of jobs out there’).” All three of these frames have been used in past eras. For example, Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past, so segregation was something blacks could and should accept. Similarly, cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism. But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today.\n\nAs I indicated above, not only does Bonilla-Silva’s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another, it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “naturalizes, normalizes and moralizes itself, so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify, much less name, and fight against.” Indeed, this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “common sense” emerges, responding to multiple different needs at once, most typically, a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible, and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible. The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude, even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact. Meanwhile, those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order, even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics.\n\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic, the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals, such bringing people together, establishing peace and harmony, promoting tolerance and so forth. It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else, and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done. Not only does white supremacy lay down the law, if conflicts arise in response, white supremacy takes the lead in naming, identifying and analyzing them, leading to proposed white supremacist solutions. On a macro scale, this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale, from the lowliest parts on up to the whole.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society. It was originally founded to bring together two politically disparate groups, Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders, both united by the belief that free blacks faced a miserable future in America, and would be better off in Africa. This granddaddy of all “grand bargains” was laughable on its face — there hundreds of thousands of free blacks, far more than could ever be returned to Africa, even if they had all wanted to go — which most emphatically did not. But it was extremely popular with political elites, precisely because of its centrist power to “bring people together” — white people, that is. In his book, \"Of One Blood: Abolitionism and the Origins of Racial Equality,\" historian Paul Goodman had this to say:\n\nBy 1817, African colonization had become more than a speculative idea. In the next decade, hundreds of prominent Americans--political leaders including Presidents Madison and Monroe and religious leaders in most of the large denominations, from Presbyterian Lyman Beecher of Massachusetts to Episcopalian bishop William Mead of Virginia—threw their prestige and influence behind the America Colonization Society (ACS), which established the colony of Liberia in West Africa. One of the most impressive voluntary societies of its day, the ACS boasted over two hundred state and local auxiliaries by 1830. It was quietly assisted by President Monroe and endorsed by state legislatures and the major religious denominations, as well as by an illustrious panoply of notables.\n\nAs Goodman goes on to describe, the 19th-Century abolitionist movement was born out of free blacks’ opposition to the ACS. It was precisely their unwillingness to be “reasonable” which formed the foundation of resistance which eventually spread to white abolitionists, and over a period five decades, eventually resulted in emancipation. Yet, almost up until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation he himself continued to be a supporter of colonization — such was the power of this “centrist” white supremacist vision. In fact, the ACS lived on for almost 100 years after Lincoln’s death — it only shut down in 1964!\n\nThere are many other instances in which the cause of black freedom only advanced by refusing to be “reasonable” or to live up to some purported virtue or another. That’s because white supremacy, in one form or another, has always had such an enormous say in dictating what it meant to be “reasonable” or virtuous. And so it’s been incumbent on blacks to learn to think outside the box — to find a broader framework of understanding on which to found their moral as well as their political analysis.\n\nThis is why Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once spoke to the American Psychological Association, and came out proudly for the cause of what he called “creative maladjustment”:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI am sure that we will recognize that there are some things in our society, some things in our world, to which we should never be adjusted. There are some things concerning which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will. We must never adjust ourselves to racial discrimination and racial segregation. We must never adjust ourselves to religious bigotry. We must never adjust ourselves to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. We must never adjust ourselves to the madness of militarism, and the self-defeating effects of physical violence…. Thus, it may well be that our world is in dire need of a new organization, The International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment.\n\nSimilarly, King’s “Letter From Birmingham Jail” was all about rejecting the framework of passive, superficial words of peace, moderation and restraint which the white ministers of Birmingham sought to impose on him. Here is just a small section of the wisdom it contains:\n\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with.\n\nI could not help myself thinking about the profound wrong-headed of “reasonable” white supremacy as I heard Nikki Haley’s speech, which is why my enthusiasm for it was so dimmed. In perhaps her most deeply typical move, she said there didn’t have to be winners and losers. Folks who love the flag and folks who despise it can all get along just fine! But, of course, that leaves the entire substantive agenda Reverend Barber spoke about dead on arrival — just as it was supposed to do. There is no real underlying intent to address and disown the evil of white supremacy. The only way that evil is faced is by projecting it onto the disowned Confederate son, Dylann Roof.\n\nA good way to understand what’s wrong with Haley’s speech is to compare it with a speech by a quintessential white Southerner, Strom Thurmond’s son, whose speech makes no such attempt to defend the blind worship of “heritage.” Here is what South Carolina State Senator Paul Thurmond said:\n\nI am aware of my heritage. But my appreciation for the things that my forebearers accomplished to make my life better doesn’t mean that I must believe that they always made the right decisions and, for the life of me, I will never understand how anyone could fight a civil war based, in part, on the desire to continue the practice of slavery. Think about it for just a second. Our ancestors were literally fighting to continue to keep human beings as slaves and continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will. I am not proud of this heritage. These practices were inhumane and were wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\nWhere Haley felt the need to comfort — even identify with — those who see the flag as a symbol of noble heritage, Paul Thurmond simply said, “I am not proud.” Simple as that. A clean break. And that, my friends, is what America needs, where white supremacy is concerned. A clean break — and then the real business of a creating a livable future for all of us can begin.",

Netanyahu was asked directly about whether his Bar-Ilan speech was “ irrelevant. ” Here is what Netanyahu actually said :\nNETANYAHU : I think anyone who is going to build a Palestinian state today will be freeing up space to give an attack area to radical Islam against Israel .

We 're making some additional modest changes to get to balance . '' Ryan , R-Wis. , told reporters at briefing last week . `` We 're adding some other policies that finish the job , but I would n't expect big surprises from us next week .

''\nThis time , Ryan points to two unlikely factors that actually help achieve the conservative goal : revenue and sequestration .\n`` Revenue went up significantly two months ago with the `` Fiscal Cliff '' deal . The baselines changed . We 're not going to refight that fight , '' Ryan said , referring to $ 600 billion in new tax revenue President Obama secured in the deal . `` We also have some lower spending and lower deficits in that baseline as well [ as a result of sequestration ] . ''\nWhile Ryan is the chief author of the GOP 's budget proposal , he does not work alone and there are varying perspectives .

''\nBut some GOP insiders confidentially question whether Ryan can pass his budget out of a committee markup this week . Republicans hold a narrow 22-17 seat advantage over Democrats on the committee . With Democrats ideologically against his proposals , Ryan can only afford losing two Republicans before a third dissenter stalls the resolution in committee .\n`` Ryan 's budget is facing opposition from many sides , including within his own committee , '' one Republican congressional source said on the condition of anonymity . `` He loses votes on everything from Medicare and entitlement changes to his drastic discretionary cuts , and it will be difficult for him to pass his budget out of committee , let alone the House floor . ''\nWhile Ryan would not elaborate on any details from his new budget ahead of Tuesday 's release , there are reports he could raise the threshold at which people are protected from changes to the Medicare eligibility age .\nOn the House floor , Republicans hold a 232-200 majority , plus there are three vacant seats . With 216 votes constituting a simple majority , House Speaker John Boehner and Ryan can lose just 16 rank and file Republicans . Last year 10 Republicans voted against the Ryan budget on the floor , but in the new session of Congress where the GOP 's majority is slimmer than the last session , Boehner has needed Democratic votes to pass several essential pieces of legislation .\nAt a pen and pad briefing last week , Ryan did his best to assure reporters that all Republican members on the committee are `` unified .

''\nWhile some of the most conservative Republicans griped in the past that Ryan 's budgets did not cut spending quickly enough , Rep. Tom Cole , a member of both the Budget and Appropriations committees , called Ryan 's bid the `` most aggressive budget by any majority in recent years . ''\nWhile meeting the spending caps could puzzle the appropriators ' work later this year , Cole urged House Republicans to rally around Ryan 's proposal .

Congress and the White House reached a deal Tuesday that would provide another $ 310 billion .\nTo get the loans forgiven , companies need to spend 75 % on payroll within eight weeks of receiving the money . The other 25 % can be spent on rent , utilities , and mortgage payments . Otherwise , the loan has generous terms : Only a 1 % interest rate and six months before any principal is due .\nMany of the small companies that were able to obtain a loan are having second thoughts about rehiring all their workers and a few plan to return the money . Others will use what they can on rent and utilities , and will use some to rehire a portion of their laid-off staff . But most are unsure they will be able to reopen eight weeks from now . They see little point in rehiring all their workers , paying them to do little or nothing , and then potentially laying them off again if business remains weak two months from now .\n“ You ’ re turning the business into a pass through for the federal government , ” said Joe Walsh , who owns Clean Green Maine , a cleaning service in Portland , Maine with 35 employees . “ You ’ re doing very little to actually help the business . ”\nIt ’ s unclear how much the small business lending program can hold back the surge in joblessness — a record 22 million people sought unemployment aid in the past month . Most economists forecast the unemployment rate will reach between 15 % and 20 % when the monthly jobs report is released in early May .\nMore money is clearly needed : Roughly 1.6 million small companies were able to obtain loans , the Small Business Administration said , out of at least 6 million that were likely eligible , according to Census data . Bank of America economists estimate that another $ 650 billion would be necessary to meet demand .\nAlso , the generous unemployment aid that was also included in the government ’ s relief package has made it more difficult to rehire . Many workers are making more with unemployment checks , which now include a $ 600 weekly benefit from the federal government .\nWalsh , who received a $ 280,000 loan from the SBA , said that he is reluctant to push his employees to return to work because , under unemployment benefit rules , they could lose their weekly checks if they turn down potential jobs .\n“ That ’ s just putting me as the employer in a really difficult position , ” Walsh said . He pays at least $ 17 an hour , with benefits , but his former employees are getting the equivalent of roughly $ 25 an hour from unemployment .\nRight now , Walsh ’ s business is closed due to lack of demand for cleaning services . He hopes to reopen soon and bring back some workers , retrain them on new sanitizing processes , and earn a bit of revenue . Still , he doubts his business will be anywhere close to what it was anytime soon , which means his workforce won ’ t be either .\n“ There ’ s no way that I ’ m getting to 100 % employment by the end of 8 weeks , ” he said .\nThe National Federation for Independent Business , a small business advocacy group , is pushing the government to make it easier for loans to be forgiven .\nThe group wants the SBA to eliminate the requirement that 75 % be spent on payroll , or at least reduce it to 50 % . It also wants the rehiring window extended beyond eight weeks and is pushing for a “ good faith ” provision that would credit companies for trying to rehire workers who prefer unemployment aid instead .\nThe NFIB also asked that half the next round of funding be reserved for businesses with fewer than 20 employees , to counter complaints that many large , publicly-traded companies obtained loans in the first round . The agreement reached late Tuesday did not make that change but directed some funds to smaller banks .\nAccording to a survey of its members , the NFIB said that just half of those who have applied for loans expect that they will rehire all their workers and get the entire amount forgiven . A quarter expect that at least three-quarters of the loan will be forgiven , while 15 % didn ’ t know .\nThe American Sustainable Business Council and several other small business groups are pushing to have the starting date for rehiring shifted from the date a company received a loan to the date it can legally reopen .

         "I can not wait to learn more about the identity and motives of the secret whistleblower who figures so prominently in stories of Trump ’ s phone call with the newly elected Ukrainian president . The narrative that began a month ago , as an insider ’ s accusation of Trump ’ s threat to cut off U.S. military aid unless investigations were launched into his expected opponent Joe Biden , has evolved considerably .\nIt now appears — in spite of initial denials — that the whistleblower consulted with House Intelligence Committee ( HIC ) staff before filing his complaint — and was advised immediately to obtain counsel . Somehow , the chosen counsel was part of a whistleblower search organization , whose staff had previously worked with HIC chairman Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) . While the whistleblower ’ s complaint was based entirely on secondhand hearsay — which was explicitly precluded under existing reporting rules — those rules were changed after the complaint ’ s receipt so as to do away with the requirement of firsthand knowledge .\nWhat began as an admission that the whistleblower worked for the CIA and was a registered Democrat was accompanied by the absolute assurance that he was not an active partisan and had not worked in any current presidential campaign . That assurance now seems to be evolving into a situation in which the whistleblower had been assigned to the National Security Council , where he worked with former Vice President Biden — and may even have traveled with him on one or more trips to Ukraine .\nWords are being chosen quite carefully , and the truth seems more and more elusive , as Republican HIC members continue to be kept in the dark . One is reminded of Lewis Carroll ’ s Alice in Wonderland , in which Alice exclaims , “ Curiouser and curiouser ! ”\nWhile the mainstream media continues to provide breathless coverage as events unfold , they evidence a strong disinclination to ferret out more information regarding the whistleblower ’ s actual identity or motives in coming forward — almost relishing the idea that HIC hearings can feature his testimony ( whether he is actually present or not ) without his identity ever becoming known .\nThe obvious parallel is to “ Deep Throat , ” Woodward and Bernstein ’ s alleged secret source for many of their Watergate revelations , whose identity remained not only secret but also an integral part of Georgetown cocktail conversation for the next 30 years .\nFor those not living through the halcyon days of Watergate , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein became famous for their series of revelations regarding the status of prosecutors ’ ongoing Watergate investigations , but it was not until their 1974 book , All the President ’ s Men , that they credited a secret source they claimed to have referred to as “ Deep Throat , ” after a popular pornographic movie character . The more recent backstory is that their publisher at Simon & Schuster had encouraged them to add more drama to their proposed book , which is how the term first came into being . In short , Deep Throat was not a term used in print or even newsroom discussions before it first appeared in their book — as their calculatedly mysterious source .\nRegardless , speculation about just who Deep Throat might be was a dominant feature of Washington gossip for the ensuing decades . Possible candidates were inevitably confined to those who had served on President Nixon ’ s White House staff , including his Chief of Staff Alexander Haig , one of his many lawyers ( John Dean , Fred Fielding , Len Garment , or Fred Buzhardt ) , one of his speechwriters ( Bill Safire , David Gergen , or Ben Stein ) , or one of other young White House aides ( including Diane Sawyer , Jonathan Rose , or Jeff Donfeld ) . Even Henry Kissinger ’ s name occasionally surfaced in the unending speculation .\nThe common theme was that Deep Throat had become so disgusted with Nixon ’ s conduct that the need to reveal the wrongdoing far outweighed any idea of loyalty to the president . This was in spite of the fact that my boss and Nixon ’ s lead Watergate defense counsel thought at the time that the leaks were coming from Mark Felt at the FBI . This belief was accompanied by the recognition that we weren ’ t in a position to do much about it , since pressuring Felt might result in even more leaks . In fact , there is a humorous conversation on the White House tapes in which Haig suggests to Nixon that Felt is the one doing the leaking — and characterizes him as “ the white rat. ” Haig goes on to explain that ’ s what Felt is called behind his back at the Bureau : He has a long face and a rather sallow complexion . “ Well , Mr. President , he looks like a rat , ” is how Haig finally sums it up .\nFor decades afterwards , when I would mention that I had worked on Nixon ’ s White House staff , people would inevitably ask if I knew who Deep Throat was . When I answered in the affirmative , they would get all excited — until I said it was Mark Felt , the white rat . Then , since this obviously was not some famous name from Nixon ’ s own White House , their interest would wane and the conversation would move on .\nWhen Felt ’ s daughter claimed he was Deep Throat in 2005 and Woodward and Bernstein rushed out a book , The Secret Man : The Story of Watergate ’ s Deep Throat , supposedly confirming it , everyone accepted it at face value . For his part , Felt was way too senile to provide any real confirmation . More significantly , it turned out that Felt had no animosity toward President Nixon ; his leaks were designed to show that Acting FBI Director Patrick Gray couldn ’ t control the FBI and should be replaced by then–Deputy Director Felt .\nWhy , then , had all of the media been so certain for the prior three decades that Deep Throat simply had to be a disillusioned Nixon White House staffer ?

         "I cannot wait to learn more about the identity and motives of the secret whistleblower who figures so prominently in stories of Trump’s phone call with the newly elected Ukrainian president. The narrative that began a month ago, as an insider’s accusation of Trump’s threat to cut off U.S. military aid unless investigations were launched into his expected opponent Joe Biden, has evolved considerably.\n\nIt now appears — in spite of initial denials — that the whistleblower consulted with House Intelligence Committee (HIC) staff before filing his complaint — and was advised immediately to obtain counsel. Somehow, the chosen counsel was part of a whistleblower search organization, whose staff had previously worked with HIC chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). While the whistleblower’s complaint was based entirely on secondhand hearsay — which was explicitly precluded under existing reporting rules — those rules were changed after the complaint’s receipt so as to do away with the requirement of firsthand knowledge.\n\nWhat began as an admission that the whistleblower worked for the CIA and was a registered Democrat was accompanied by the absolute assurance that he was not an active partisan and had not worked in any current presidential campaign. That assurance now seems to be evolving into a situation in which the whistleblower had been assigned to the National Security Council, where he worked with former Vice President Biden — and may even have traveled with him on one or more trips to Ukraine.\n\nWords are being chosen quite carefully, and the truth seems more and more elusive, as Republican HIC members continue to be kept in the dark. One is reminded of Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, in which Alice exclaims, “Curiouser and curiouser!”\n\nWhile the mainstream media continues to provide breathless coverage as events unfold, they evidence a strong disinclination to ferret out more information regarding the whistleblower’s actual identity or motives in coming forward — almost relishing the idea that HIC hearings can feature his testimony (whether he is actually present or not) without his identity ever becoming known.\n\nThe obvious parallel is to “Deep Throat,” Woodward and Bernstein’s alleged secret source for many of their Watergate revelations, whose identity remained not only secret but also an integral part of Georgetown cocktail conversation for the next 30 years.\n\nFor those not living through the halcyon days of Watergate, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein became famous for their series of revelations regarding the status of prosecutors’ ongoing Watergate investigations, but it was not until their 1974 book, All the President’s Men, that they credited a secret source they claimed to have referred to as “Deep Throat,” after a popular pornographic movie character. The more recent backstory is that their publisher at Simon & Schuster had encouraged them to add more drama to their proposed book, which is how the term first came into being. In short, Deep Throat was not a term used in print or even newsroom discussions before it first appeared in their book — as their calculatedly mysterious source.\n\nRegardless, speculation about just who Deep Throat might be was a dominant feature of Washington gossip for the ensuing decades. Possible candidates were inevitably confined to those who had served on President Nixon’s White House staff, including his Chief of Staff Alexander Haig, one of his many lawyers (John Dean, Fred Fielding, Len Garment, or Fred Buzhardt), one of his speechwriters (Bill Safire, David Gergen, or Ben Stein), or one of other young White House aides (including Diane Sawyer, Jonathan Rose, or Jeff Donfeld). Even Henry Kissinger’s name occasionally surfaced in the unending speculation.\n\nThe common theme was that Deep Throat had become so disgusted with Nixon’s conduct that the need to reveal the wrongdoing far outweighed any idea of loyalty to the president. This was in spite of the fact that my boss and Nixon’s lead Watergate defense counsel thought at the time that the leaks were coming from Mark Felt at the FBI. This belief was accompanied by the recognition that we weren’t in a position to do much about it, since pressuring Felt might result in even more leaks. In fact, there is a humorous conversation on the White House tapes in which Haig suggests to Nixon that Felt is the one doing the leaking — and characterizes him as “the white rat.” Haig goes on to explain that’s what Felt is called behind his back at the Bureau: He has a long face and a rather sallow complexion. “Well, Mr. President, he looks like a rat,” is how Haig finally sums it up.\n\nFor decades afterwards, when I would mention that I had worked on Nixon’s White House staff, people would inevitably ask if I knew who Deep Throat was. When I answered in the affirmative, they would get all excited — until I said it was Mark Felt, the white rat. Then, since this obviously was not some famous name from Nixon’s own White House, their interest would wane and the conversation would move on.\n\nWhen Felt’s daughter claimed he was Deep Throat in 2005 and Woodward and Bernstein rushed out a book, The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate’s Deep Throat, supposedly confirming it, everyone accepted it at face value. For his part, Felt was way too senile to provide any real confirmation. More significantly, it turned out that Felt had no animosity toward President Nixon; his leaks were designed to show that Acting FBI Director Patrick Gray couldn’t control the FBI and should be replaced by then–Deputy Director Felt.\n\nWhy, then, had all of the media been so certain for the prior three decades that Deep Throat simply had to be a disillusioned Nixon White House staffer? Following Felt’s 2005 outing, I went back and re-read All the President’s Men and then compared the book to the subsequent movie version — only to discover tantalizing differences in Deep Throat’s treatment.\n\nIn their book, there is no implication whatsoever that Deep Throat is a White House employee. The authors were very careful not to give any hint at all as to his place of employment. The movie version, however, differs considerably — with implied White House employment occurring in three separate scenes: First, relatively early on, Woodward (played by Robert Redford) and Bernstein (played by Dustin Hoffman) are shown on the Library of Congress steps, lamenting that they are out of leads.

I don’t know how many meetings in the garage.… There’s a residual fear in my soul that that isn’t quite straight.\n\nIt also is interesting to note that lead Watergate prosecutor Earl Silbert has stated that nothing in the Woodward and Bernstein articles was helpful to his team of prosecutors since their stories were only reporting what the government already knew and had under investigation.

         "WASHINGTON – For the first time in his presidency , Donald Trump gave his State of the Union address to a divided Congress . The president did n't flinch as he faced a House of Representatives led by Democrats who have recently pushed for late-term abortions .\nTrump boldly pushed back on that agenda , saying America 's leaders need to `` work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life . '' The president then called on Congress to pass legislation to prohibit late-term abortions .\n`` Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother 's womb moments before birth , '' Trump said . `` These are living , feeling , beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world . ''\n`` And then , we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth , '' the president continued . `` All children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of God .

         "WASHINGTON – For the first time in his presidency, Donald Trump gave his State of the Union address to a divided Congress. The president didn't flinch as he faced a House of Representatives led by Democrats who have recently pushed for late-term abortions.\n\nTrump boldly pushed back on that agenda, saying America's leaders need to \"work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.\" The president then called on Congress to pass legislation to prohibit late-term abortions.\n\n\n\n\"Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth,\" Trump said. \"These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world.\"\n\n\"And then, we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth,\" the president continued. \"All children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of God.\"\n\nThe Case for a Border Wall\n\n\n\nThe commander in chief also broke down his vision for safe and legal immigration, demanding a wall be constructed along America's southern border.\n\nHe illustrated his point by hosting the family members of Gerald and Sharon David, an elderly couple murdered in their Nevada home just last month by an immigrant who was in the US illegally.\n\n\"I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again,\" Trump said. \"Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.\"\n\n\"Simply put – walls save lives,\" he stated. \"In the past, most people in this room voted for a wall – but the proper wall never got built.

         "By cutting funds for Head Start , sequestration has sent low-income children in some states home 10 days early . But the federal government 's inability to agree on a budget did n't prevent 2,800 Head Start leaders from attending a three-day conference in National Harbor , Md. , this week .\nChalk it up to the peculiarities of the sequester . In this case , it 's O.K . to cut classes for kids , but not O.K . to reallocate Training and Technical Assistance funds .\nNational Harbor is along the Potomac River , just over the border from Washington , D.C. ; it offers hotels , restaurants , shopping and a marina . The Office of Head Start held its second annual `` National Birth to Five Leadership Institute '' conference at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center . Rooms went for $ 224 per room per night , a rate set by the U.S General Services Administration ; according to Kenneth Wolfe , deputy director of Administration for Children & Families ' office of public affairs , the event 's total approved cost was $ 752,059 , not including the cost of the stay , meals and air-fare for the grantees .\nThe conference included seminars and lectures focused on teaching parents , educators and administrators to use data to improve programs . Head Start 's mission is to help low-income children from birth to age five develop socially and cognitively before they enter the formal education system .\nCommunity Action Partnership of Kern ( CAPK ) in Bakersfield , Calif. , sent four team members to the training .\nCAPK had to reduce the number of days they offer their program this year from 168 to 158 , two days below the national standard minimum . Next year they plan to operate 160 days .\nMark Corum , outreach and resource development manager for CAPK , said any day their children are n't attending Head Start is a detriment to both the children 's learning and the parents .\n`` Ideally we 're trying to help people with a safety net . You know , they 've fallen through the cracks , '' Corum told ███ on Thursday . `` It 's the total family that we bring and embrace and try to make them better . ''\nHe 's seen `` firsthand '' how the program has helped parents and children with achieve success in life .\nTo celebrate Head Start and protest the cuts , Massachusetts organizers are planning a parade on Boston Common for May 31 .\nThey `` [ h ] ope to … perhaps convince some folks in Washington that our children are as important as air traffic controllers and meat inspectors and that they should seriously consider rescinding this foolish sequester that is causing havoc with the lives of our most underprivileged families , '' John Drew , president and CEO of Action for Boston Community Development ( ABCD ) , told ███ in an email Thursday .\nREAD MORE : Pre-School for All : President Obama 's Pipe Dream or Possibility ?\nThe Boston-area Head Start programs considered cutting as many as 250 slots for children at the onset of the sequester cuts . They are continuing to figure out `` how many classes , children , teachers and parents will be left behind , '' when cuts go into effect for their programs in September , Drew said . Of their 650-person staff , ABCD sent two to the conference .\nSo how can programs facing a 5.2 percent decrease in their budgets afford to send staff to the national conference ?\nGroups are drawing from a section of their budget set aside for `` Training and Technical Assistance . '' Congress allocates funds for this separately from Head Start 's operating costs , and the Office of Head Start absorbed all of the TTA sequester cuts , so that grantee 's TTA budgets would remain intact .\n`` The Office of Head Start is committed to working with programs to ensure the provision of high-quality services continue during this challenging time of sequestration , '' Kenneth Wolfe , deputy director of Administration for Children & Families ' office of public affairs , told ███ in an email .\nTTA money can not be reallocated to cover operating costs without direction from Congress .\nSo while Vanessa Gibbons , director of Jackson County Civic Action Committee in Moss Point , Miss. , would rather use the money to continue giving her young students a safe place to go before their older siblings ' schools let out for the summer , she instead has had to cut her program 10 days short this year .\n`` They specifically told us we could not cut our training budget . Those dollars were not even in the equation . That would have made it easy . But that was not even an option , '' Gibbons told ███ .\nThe problem is similar to the one the Federal Aviation Administration faced , which led them to furlough workers and space out flights in a way that slowed air travel . But Congress quickly passed a measure giving the FAA the flexibility to reallocate unused improvement funds in order to quash the irksome flight delays .\nREAD MORE : Food Safety , Unemployment , Flood Predictors Still Subject to Sequestration\nSome on the left have criticized Congress for a bill targeted at helping the FAA .\n`` Members of Congress fly often , so they 're fixing that sequester mess , '' New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote on Twitter . `` But no fix for kids sequestered out of Head Start . ''\nRep. Rosa DeLauro , D-Conn. , posted an animation of an airplane on Twitter with the hashtag , `` # endthesequester . ''\n`` 4 million meals for seniors eliminated … 70,000 children kicked out of Head Start … 125,000 Americans without rental assistance , '' the message in white lettering on the black plane read . `` But your next flight will be on time .

Next year they plan to operate 160 days.\n\nREAD MORE: 57 Terrible Consequences of the Sequester\n\nMark Corum, outreach and resource development manager for CAPK, said any day their children aren't attending Head Start is a detriment to both the children's learning and the parents.\n\n\"Ideally we're trying to help people with a safety net. You know, they've fallen through the cracks,\" Corum told ABC News on Thursday. \"It's the total family that we bring and embrace and try to make them better.\"\n\nHe's seen \"firsthand\" how the program has helped parents and children with achieve success in life.\n\nTo celebrate Head Start and protest the cuts, Massachusetts organizers are planning a parade on Boston Common for May 31.\n\nThey \"[h]ope to … perhaps convince some folks in Washington that our children are as important as air traffic controllers and meat inspectors and that they should seriously consider rescinding this foolish sequester that is causing havoc with the lives of our most underprivileged families,\" John Drew, president and CEO of Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD), told ABC News in an email Thursday.\n\nREAD MORE: Pre-School for All: President Obama's Pipe Dream or Possibility?\n\nThe Boston-area Head Start programs considered cutting as many as 250 slots for children at the onset of the sequester cuts. They are continuing to figure out \"how many classes, children, teachers and parents will be left behind,\" when cuts go into effect for their programs in September, Drew said. Of their 650-person staff, ABCD sent two to the conference.\n\nSo how can programs facing a 5.2 percent decrease in their budgets afford to send staff to the national conference?\n\nGroups are drawing from a section of their budget set aside for \"Training and Technical Assistance.\" Congress allocates funds for this separately from Head Start's operating costs, and the Office of Head Start absorbed all of the TTA sequester cuts, so that grantee's TTA budgets would remain intact.\n\n\"The Office of Head Start is committed to working with programs to ensure the provision of high-quality services continue during this challenging time of sequestration,\" Kenneth Wolfe, deputy director of Administration for Children & Families' office of public affairs, told ABC News in an email.\n\nTTA money cannot be reallocated to cover operating costs without direction from Congress.\n\nSo while Vanessa Gibbons, director of Jackson County Civic Action Committee in Moss Point, Miss., would rather use the money to continue giving her young students a safe place to go before their older siblings' schools let out for the summer, she instead has had to cut her program 10 days short this year.\n\n\"They specifically told us we could not cut our training budget. Those dollars were not even in the equation. That would have made it easy. But that was not even an option,\" Gibbons told ABC News.\n\nThe problem is similar to the one the Federal Aviation Administration faced, which led them to furlough workers and space out flights in a way that slowed air travel. But Congress quickly passed a measure giving the FAA the flexibility to reallocate unused improvement funds in order to quash the irksome flight delays.\n\nREAD MORE: Food Safety, Unemployment, Flood Predictors Still Subject to Sequestration\n\nSome on the left have criticized Congress for a bill targeted at helping the FAA.\n\n\"Members of Congress fly often, so they're fixing that sequester mess,\" New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote on Twitter. \"But no fix for kids sequestered out of Head Start.\"\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., posted an animation of an airplane on Twitter with the hashtag, \"#endthesequester.\"\n\n\"4 million meals for seniors eliminated … 70,000 children kicked out of Head Start … 125,000 Americans without rental assistance,\" the message in white lettering on the black plane read. \"But your next flight will be on time.\"",

         "As a first step , I believe it necessary for the members and leadership of the Democratic National Committee to step down and be replaced by people who are determined to create a party that represents America – including all those who feel powerless and disenfranchised , and who have been left out of our politics and left behind in our economy .\nThe Democratic Party as it is now constituted has become a giant fundraising machine , too often reflecting the goals and values of the moneyed interests . This must change . The election of 2016 has repudiated it . We need a people ’ s party – a party capable of organizing and mobilizing Americans in opposition to Donald Trump ’ s Republican party , which is about to take over all three branches of the U.S. government . We need a New Democratic Party that will fight against intolerance and widening inequality .\nWhat happened in America Tuesday should not be seen as a victory for hatefulness over decency . It is more accurately understood as a repudiation of the American power structure .\nAt the core of that structure are the political leaders of both parties , their political operatives , and fundraisers ; the major media , centered in New York and Washington DC ; the country ’ s biggest corporations , their top executives , and Washington lobbyists and trade associations ; the biggest Wall Street banks , their top officers , traders , hedge-fund and private-equity managers , and their lackeys in Washington ; and the wealthy individuals who invest directly in politics .\nAt the start of the 2016 election cycle , this power structure proclaimed Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush shoo-ins for the nominations of the Democratic and Republican parties . After all , both of these individuals had deep bases of funders , well-established networks of political insiders , experienced political advisers and all the political name recognition any candidate could possibly want .\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the White House . The presidency was won by Donald Trump , who made his fortune marketing office towers and casinos , and , more recently , starring in a popular reality-television program , and who has never held elective office or had anything to do with the Republican party . Hillary Clinton narrowly won the popular vote , but not enough of the states and their electors secure a victory .\nHillary Clinton ’ s defeat is all the more remarkable in that her campaign vastly outspent the Trump campaign on television and radio advertisements , and get-out-the-vote efforts . Moreover , her campaign had the support in the general election not of only the kingpins of the Democratic party but also many leading Republicans , including most of the politically active denizens of Wall Street and the top executives of America ’ s largest corporations , and even former Republican president George HW Bush . Her campaign team was run by seasoned professionals who knew the ropes . She had the visible and forceful backing of Barack Obama , whose popularity has soared in recent months , and his popular wife . And , of course , she had her husband .\nTrump , by contrast , was shunned by the power structure . Mitt Romney , the Republican presidential candidate in 2012 , actively worked against Trump ’ s nomination . Many senior Republicans refused to endorse him , or even give him their support . The Republican National Committee did not raise money for Trump to the extent it had for other Republican candidates for president .\nThere had been hints of the political earthquake to come . Trump had won the Republican primaries , after all . More tellingly , Clinton had been challenged in the Democratic primaries by the unlikeliest of candidates – a 74-year-old Jewish senator from Vermont who described himself as a democratic socialist and who was not even a Democrat . Bernie Sanders went on to win 22 states and 47 percent of the vote in those primaries . Sanders ’ major theme was that the country ’ s political and economic system was rigged in favor of big corporations , Wall Street and the very wealthy .\nThe power structure of America wrote off Sanders as an aberration , and , until recently , didn ’ t take Trump seriously . A respected political insider recently told me most Americans were largely content with the status quo . “ The economy is in good shape , ” he said . “ Most Americans are better off than they ’ ve been in years . ”\nRecent economic indicators may be up , but those indicators don ’ t reflect the insecurity most Americans continue to feel , nor the seeming arbitrariness and unfairness they experience . Nor do the major indicators show the linkages many Americans see between wealth and power , stagnant or declining real wages , soaring CEO pay , and the undermining of democracy by big money .\nMedian family income is lower now than it was 16 years ago , adjusted for inflation . Workers without college degrees – the old working class – have fallen furthest . Most economic gains , meanwhile , have gone to top . These gains have translated into political power to elicit bank bailouts , corporate subsidies , special tax loopholes , favorable trade deals and increasing market power without interference by anti-monopoly enforcement – all of which have further reduced wages and pulled up profits .\nWealth , power and crony capitalism fit together . Americans know a takeover has occurred , and they blame the establishment for it .\nThe Democratic party once represented the working class . But over the last three decades the party has been taken over by Washington-based fundraisers , bundlers , analysts , and pollsters who have focused instead on raising campaign money from corporate and Wall Street executives and getting votes from upper middle-class households in “ swing ” suburbs .\nDemocrats have occupied the White House for 16 of the last 24 years , and for four of those years had control of both houses of Congress . But in that time they failed to reverse the decline in working-class wages and economic security . Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ardently pushed for free trade agreements without providing millions of blue-collar workers who thereby lost their jobs means of getting new ones that paid at least as well .\nThey stood by as corporations hammered trade unions , the backbone of the white working class – failing to reform labor laws to impose meaningful penalties on companies that violate them , or help workers form unions with simple up-or-down votes . Partly as a result , union membership sank from 22 percent of all workers when Bill Clinton was elected president to less than 12 percenttoday , and the working class lost bargaining leverage to get a share of the economy ’ s gains .\nBill Clinton and Obama also allowed antitrust enforcement to ossify – with the result that large corporations have grown far larger , and major industries more concentrated . The unsurprising result of this combination – more trade , declining unionization and more industry concentration – has been to shift political and economic power to big corporations and the wealthy , and to shaft the working class . This created an opening for Donald Trump ’ s authoritarian demagoguery , and his presidency .\nNow Americans have rebelled by supporting someone who wants to fortify America against foreigners as well as foreign-made goods . The power structure understandably fears that Trump ’ s isolationism will stymie economic growth . But most Americans couldn ’ t care less about growth because for years they have received few of its benefits , while suffering most of its burdens in the forms of lost jobs and lower wages .\nThe power structure is shocked by the outcome of the 2016 election because it has cut itself off from the lives of most Americans .

         "Note From Senior Management : This piece was erroneously framed by our author as a “ fact check , ” when , instead , it was and should have been framed as an opinion piece . The opinion that the author was trying to convey was his belief that nobody in their right mind would think that Trump was literally suggesting that people should inject disinfectant into their bodies – which is how many in the media were portraying the President ’ s comments at yesterday ’ s press conference . The piece has been re-framed as it should have been originally ( as opinion ) , and further updated to reflect President Trump ’ s statement this morning that he was being sarcastic . We apologize for the error , and you are welcome for all the opportunities to dunk on us on Twitter .\nAfter yesterday ’ s Coronavirus Task Force press briefing , the media quickly seized on a discussion over potential treatments for the coronavirus COVID-19 where the president asked about the potential for a disinfectant injection .\n“ And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute . One minute . And is there a way we can do something like that , by injection inside or almost a cleaning ? ” The President said . “ So it ’ d be interesting to check that . ”\nThe President told a group of reporters Friday that he was being sarcastic .\nIn Thursday ’ s White House coronavirus task force briefing , Bill Bryan , leader of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security , described the results of new government research that showed that the coronavirus did not survive long in solar light , warmer temperatures , and more humid conditions . He added that disinfectants had also been effective against it .\nTrump , responding to that , noted that there had been discussions of testing ultraviolet light on patients , or of methods to bring light inside the body . “ And then I see the disinfectant , where it knocks it [ the virus ] out in a minute . One minute . And is there a way we can do something like that , by injection inside , or almost a cleaning , cause you see it gets in the lungs . ”\nTrump was far from a model of clarity , but he did not actually propose injecting patients with disinfectant ; he deferred to “ medical doctors ” to figure out how to apply Bryan ’ s research .\nWhen ABC News ’ Jonathan Karl asked Bryan about whether the president had proposed injecting a person with “ bleach and isopropyl alcohol ” later , Trump clarified that “ It wouldn ’ t be through injection , ” and that he was talking about “ cleaning , sterilization of an area , ” and about applying the disinfectant to “ a stationary object . ”\nApparently there is no accusation too crazy for Trump ’ s critics to believe .\nJoel B.

         "Note From Senior Management: This piece was erroneously framed by our author as a “fact check,” when, instead, it was and should have been framed as an opinion piece. The opinion that the author was trying to convey was his belief that nobody in their right mind would think that Trump was literally suggesting that people should inject disinfectant into their bodies – which is how many in the media were portraying the President’s comments at yesterday’s press conference. The piece has been re-framed as it should have been originally (as opinion), and further updated to reflect President Trump’s statement this morning that he was being sarcastic. We apologize for the error, and you are welcome for all the opportunities to dunk on us on Twitter.\n\nAfter yesterday’s Coronavirus Task Force press briefing, the media quickly seized on a discussion over potential treatments for the coronavirus COVID-19 where the president asked about the potential for a disinfectant injection.\n\n“And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?” The President said. “So it’d be interesting to check that.”\n\nThe President told a group of reporters Friday that he was being sarcastic.\n\nIn Thursday’s White House coronavirus task force briefing, Bill Bryan, leader of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, described the results of new government research that showed that the coronavirus did not survive long in solar light, warmer temperatures, and more humid conditions. He added that disinfectants had also been effective against it.\n\nTrump, responding to that, noted that there had been discussions of testing ultraviolet light on patients, or of methods to bring light inside the body. “And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it [the virus] out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside, or almost a cleaning, cause you see it gets in the lungs.”\n\nTrump was far from a model of clarity, but he did not actually propose injecting patients with disinfectant; he deferred to “medical doctors” to figure out how to apply Bryan’s research.\n\nWhen ABC News’ Jonathan Karl asked Bryan about whether the president had proposed injecting a person with “bleach and isopropyl alcohol” later, Trump clarified that “It wouldn’t be through injection,” and that he was talking about “cleaning, sterilization of an area,” and about applying the disinfectant to “a stationary object.”\n\nWhite House\n\nApparently there is no accusation too crazy for Trump’s critics to believe.\n\nJoel B.

         "After 10 years of silence - a decade of dodging questions about the infamous stain on her blue dress and the jokes about the president's cigar - Bill Clinton's mistress, Monica Lewinsky, spoke out in Vanity Fair.\n\nRemembering the Monica Lewinsky Scandal\n\nHere's what she had to say:\n\n1. She May Not Stay Quiet if Hillary Runs\n\nLewinsky says she \"remained virtually reclusive\" during Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign despite repeated interview requests. Now that Hillary is reportedly mulling a 2016 bid, Lewinsky finds herself \"gun-shy yet again, fearful of 'becoming an issue' should she decide to ramp up her campaign.\" But she's not sure she'll stay quiet this time.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who says she's still recognized everywhere she goes, has had enough of \"tiptoeing around my past - and other people's futures.\"\n\nSo though she acknowledges speaking out may have severe ramifications, \"I've decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past … It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress.\"\n\n2. What She Finds 'Troubling' About Hillary\n\nLewinsky seems to resent Hillary Clinton's reaction - and rejects the then-first lady's characterization of her as a \" narcissistic loony toon.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Clinton, I read, had supposedly confided to [Diane] Blair that, in part, she blamed herself for her husband's affair (by being emotionally neglectful) and seemed to forgive him … I find her impulse to blame the Woman - not only me, but herself - troubling,\" Lewinsky argues.\n\nHer refusal to cooperate with interrogators may have been \"courageous or foolish,\" she admits. \"But narcissistic and loony?\" No way.\n\n3. The Relationship Was Consensual\n\nLewinsky maintains that her relationship with Clinton was voluntary.\n\n\"Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship,\" Lewinsky writes. \"Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position.\"\n\nNevertheless, she says, she \"regrets\" the relationship. \"Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened.,\" she writes.\n\n4. The Clintons Didn't Pay Her Off\n\nThe Clintons didn't bribe her to stay quiet, Lewinsky insists.\n\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" she writes. She turned down $10 million-plus \"offers\" (presumably interview requests) \"because they didn't feel like the right thing to do.\"\n\nHowever, money has been an issue since the incident. Lewinsky pursued a career in marketing, but \"because of what potential employers so tactfully referred to as my 'history, I was never 'quite right' for the position.\"\n\nShe has \"managed to get by (barely, at times) with my own projects… or loans from friends,\" she says.\n\n5. She Contemplated Suicide\n\nThough she never actually attempted suicide, Lewinsky says she was tempted end her own life as \"the shame, the scorn, and the fear\" washed over her.\n\nShe says the tragic suicide of 18-year-old Tyler Clementi, the gay Rutgers student who was filmed kissing another man, brought back those terrible memories and inspired her to come forward.\n\n\"Perhaps by sharing my story … I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation,\" Lewinksi says.",

         "The United Kingdom Supreme Court has ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was acting unlawfully when he suspended Parliament in August for five weeks , a move which anti-Brexit campaigners claimed was intended to thwart their attempts to prevent Britain leaving the European Union .\nIn a shock ruling which strongly went against the government on every count , the Supreme Court in London unanimously found Tuesday morning that Boris Johnson ’ s decision to suspend Parliament was not only unlawful but was null and void , meaning it legally did not take place . Parliament is now free to sit again as soon as desired by the speakers of both houses , the court explained .\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now reacted , speaking to the BBC on a balcony of the United Nations building in New York , insisting that despite the court ruling against him this morning Brexit would still be going ahead at the end of October as planned .\nIn remarks that have already angered remainers , the Prime Minister said he regretted the decision of the court but pointed out the coalition of anti-Brexit campaigners who have worked tirelessly to prevent Britain ’ s withdrawal from going ahead .\nAs I say , I strongly disagree with this decision of the supreme court , I have the utmost respect for our judiciary , I don ’ think this was the right decision I think that the prerogative of prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge . It is perfectly usual to have Queen ’ s speech , that ’ s what we want to do . More importantly , let ’ s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit . There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU . We have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued , doesn ’ t want to have an election , and I think it is time we took things forward . …as the law currently stands , the UK leaves the EU on October the 31st come what may , but the interesting , exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal and that ’ s what we are working on .

Normal Parliamentary sessions have lasted between one and two years, being regularly suspended to clear out old unfinished legislation and to allow new government programmes to be launched.\n\nBut amid the endless Parliamentary discussion over whether to honour the result of the 2016 referendum which saw the British people vote by a margin of over one million votes — the largest democratic mandate given in British history — this Parliamentary session has rumbled on, becoming the longest since the infamous ‘long Parliament’ of the English Civil War.\n\nThe government under Mr Johnson insisted given those circumstances, and the fact the UK government has not yet been able to introduce new domestic legislation, it was reasonable to suspend Parliament.\n\nAnti-Brexit activists claim the Prime Minister not only lied to the country, but lied to the Queen, as under the British constitutional system she has to be asked as a formality to suspend Parliament.\n\nThe Associated Press has created this handy timeline of the most recent events leading up to today, to give some context for today’s ruling:\n\nJuly 24, 2019: Boris Johnson becomes prime minister after winning a party leadership contest to succeed Theresa May. He vows to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.\n\nAugust 28: Johnson suspends Parliament for a five-week period ending Oct. 14. Queen Elizabeth II approves his request, as she is required to do under Britain’s constitutional monarchy. He says it is a routine decision to set the stage for announcement of his new domestic agenda, but House of Commons Speaker John Bercow calls it a “constitutional outrage.”\n\nAugust 29: Activist Gina Miller launches legal action against Johnson at the High Court in London. Her case is subsequently joined by former prime minister John Major and others.\n\nAugust 30: In a separate case, a judge in Scotland refuses to grant an emergency measure blocking the suspension of Parliament but schedules a full hearing at a later date.\n\nSeptember 4: The Court of Session in Scotland rejects the bid to have the suspension declared unlawful.\n\nSeptember 5: The High Court in London hears Miller’s case against the suspension. Her lawyers argue the move was an “unlawful abuse of power” by the prime minister.\n\nSeptember 6: The High Court in London rejects Miller’s case. She vows to take it to the Supreme Court.\n\nSeptember 11: The Inner House of the Court of Session in Scotland rules that the suspension was illegal and was intended to “stymie” Parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline.\n\nSeptember 17: A three-day hearing on both cases begins at the Supreme Court, with 11 justices presiding.\n\nSeptember 24: The Supreme Court is scheduled to announce its decision.",

         "The horrific story of the unarmed Walter Scott 's death at the hands of Officer Michael Slager continues to reverberate . Aside from the incontrovertible evidence on the tape that the accused officer shot him in the back as if he were doing target practice , there has since emerged more tape of the traffic stop itself and audio of the officer speaking with his superiors on the phone raising even more questions about his state of mind at the time of the shooting . But as journalists have gone back and studied the officer 's record and found that he was previously investigated for taser abuse . And on even further investigation it was found that this jurisdiction is known as `` Taser town '' :\nUntil the eight shots heard ’ round the world , cops in North Charleston , South Carolina , were primarily distinguished by their zesty use of Tasers . As computed by a local newspaper in 2006 , cops there used Tasers 201 times in an 18-month period , averaging once every 40 hours in one six-month stretch and disproportionately upon African Americans . The Charleston Post & Courier did the tally after the death of a mentally ill man named Kip Black , who was tasered six times on one occasion and nine times on another . Black died immediately after the second jolting , though the coroner set the cause of death as cocaine-fueled “ excited delirium syndrome . ”\nIt 's important to note that Taser International has spent large sums convincing local coroners that this syndrome ( which primarily seems to kill people in police custody ) makes it the victim 's responsibility if they have the bad luck to die from being shot full of electricity with a taser . It 's not just illegal drugs in the system which can allegedly cause it . Adrenaline can as well . So if a person fails to remain calm in face of an arrest and finds the feeling of 50,000 volts going through their system to be stressful they have no one to blame but themselves if they die .\nThose who have been following the story of Walter Scott understand the significance of the taser . It 's not just that the officer evidently lied about Scott taking his taser , thus somehow justifying his using lethal force , or the fact that he appears to have tried to plant the taser next to the slain man 's body to cover his tracks . The man who filmed the shooting said this :\n“ I remember the police had control of the situation . He had control of Scott , and Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser . You can hear the sound of the Taser ... before I started recording . I believe he just wanted to get away from the Taser . ”\nIt 's not unusual for people to try to escape from a taser if they can . It is , quite literally , a torture device designed to force compliance with terrible pain . The people of Taser Town , particularly African American men , undoubtedly understand exactly what is going to happen if they find themselves in the custody of a police officer . Here 's one example of how it would likely go down , as reported by The Guardian :\nSlager is among three patrolmen named in a lawsuit filed by Julius Wilson , who said he was arrested after being stopped in his car in August last year . Wilson is also suing the city of North Charleston , the city police department and police chief Eddie Driggers . Speaking at a press conference on Monday , Wilson described Slager and his colleagues as “ bad , corrupt cops ” . He said : “ The use of excessive force or punishment to torture suspects is not something that should be tolerated by the North Charleston police department. ” [ ... ]\nWilson , who has a criminal record , said he was stopped on 25 August because his vehicle had a broken tail light . Scott , 50 , was stopped for the same reason on 5 April before fleeing and being shot dead by Slager . Wilson was stopped by an Officer Edwards , he said , who was joined 10 minutes later by Slager and an officer Clemens despite Wilson calmly “ making small talk and laughing ” . After refusing to step out until he was told why he was being arrested , Wilson claimed , he was forcibly pulled out of his vehicle by Slager and the two other officers . The three then “ forcibly restrained Wilson on his stomach on the pavement face down , ” the lawsuit stated . Despite Wilson “ not moving , nor resisting ” and lying with his hands above his head , the lawsuit claimed , Slager broke a silence among the officers by shouting : “ Watch out ! I ’ m going to tase ! ” He then allegedly “ shot his NCPD-issued taser into Wilson ’ s back ” . The lawsuit alleged Wilson “ writhed in pain from the electric shock ” . It said when Slager warned his colleagues he was about to fire his taser , “ Wilson was cooperating fully ” and allowing the two other officers to place his hands behind his back .\nTasers guidelines vary by department and jurisdiction , but generally their use is only considered reasonable when the subject poses a safety threat . Clearly , shooting an unarmed 50-year-old man when he runs from the taser is not one of those cases . The video of the Scott incident shows that Officer Slager is confused on that issue , to say the least . And it 's just as clear , based on that same standard , that nobody could ever claim such force is justified when presented with an unarmed suspect facing down on the ground , with his hands behind his back . Using a taser in that situation is simply a form of unofficial street justice , a little torture at the hands of the authorities to make a point . Tasers are not simply used in place of lethal force , and they 're not always used to force compliance . They are very often used as on-the-spot punishment by police who want to teach citizens a lesson .\nTake the now notorious California incident that happened to be filmed by a local news station , in which a man on horseback led police on a chase through the desert . When he fell from the horse , police swarmed and he very clearly laid down on his stomach and put his hands behind his back . Then the police beat the hell out of him and tasered him repeatedly . This footage has garnered widespread criticism because of the beating , and for good reason . It 's brutal , primitive behavior .\nBut you wo n't find many people expressing outrage about the electric shocks being administered to this man over and over again . Here 's a typical news report of the incident :\nIn video captured by cameras aboard a helicopter for KNBC , deputies gather around the man after he falls from a horse he was riding to flee from them . The video shows deputies using a stun gun on him and then repeatedly kicking and hitting him . KNBC reported that the man -- identified by authorities as Francis Pusok -- appeared to be kicked 17 times , punched 37 times and hit with a baton four times .\nAgain , if you look at the footage , Pusok was on the ground , face down with his hands behind his back before anyone tasered him or physically assaulted him . And yet the tasering is apparently considered a-ok. At the very least , it is n't mentioned as something that shocks the conscience the way the beating does.Perhaps this is because the searing pain of electro-shock does n't leave much in the way of a mark . But hideously painful it is . Yet for some reason , delivering this particular agony to a suspect is not something people reject when there is no danger to police or bystanders , and the suspect is compliant . But police do it routinely , and are rarely sanctioned for it .\nSome of this undoubtedly stems from the fact that popular culture has turned tasering into slapstick comedy . Movies and TV shows and countless Youtube videos portray it as a hilarious joke . `` Do n't tase me bro '' became as national catch phrase . But it 's not funny . Tasers can kill people . And regardless of what level of respect and compliance one thinks police are entitled to get from the public , they are not entitled to torture and punish citizens to teach them a lesson .\nWalter Scott ran from the pain of the taser and he was shot in the back numerous times for doing it . Francis Pusok was compliant and was tasered and beaten repeatedly anyway . It appears that such shootings and beatings , when captured on film anyway , are still considered beyond the pale in America these days . In both cases , officers will have to face some sanction for their behavior . Slager is facing a murder charge . It 's unknown what the California cops will face , but the FBI is investigating , so there may be some federal civil rights charges . It will be very interesting if any of the officers are charged with assault for using the taser . Let 's just say it will be among the vast minority of cases ever brought if they are .",

And it's just as clear, based on that same standard, that nobody could ever claim such force is justified when presented with an unarmed suspect facing down on the ground, with his hands behind his back. Using a taser in that situation is simply a form of unofficial street justice, a little torture at the hands of the authorities to make a point. Tasers are not simply used in place of lethal force, and they're not always used to force compliance. They are very often used as on-the-spot punishment by police who want to teach citizens a lesson.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTake the now notorious California incident that happened to be filmed by a local news station, in which a man on horseback led police on a chase through the desert. When he fell from the horse, police swarmed and he very clearly laid down on his stomach and put his hands behind his back. Then the police beat the hell out of him and tasered him repeatedly. This footage has garnered widespread criticism because of the beating, and for good reason. It's brutal, primitive behavior.\n\nBut you won't find many people expressing outrage about the electric shocks being administered to this man over and over again. Here's a typical news report of the incident:\n\nIn video captured by cameras aboard a helicopter for KNBC, deputies gather around the man after he falls from a horse he was riding to flee from them. The video shows deputies using a stun gun on him and then repeatedly kicking and hitting him. KNBC reported that the man -- identified by authorities as Francis Pusok -- appeared to be kicked 17 times, punched 37 times and hit with a baton four times.\n\nAgain, if you look at the footage, Pusok was on the ground, face down with his hands behind his back before anyone tasered him or physically assaulted him. And yet the tasering is apparently considered a-ok. At the very least, it isn't mentioned as something that shocks the conscience the way the beating does.Perhaps this is because the searing pain of electro-shock doesn't leave much in the way of a mark. But hideously painful it is. Yet for some reason, delivering this particular agony to a suspect is not something people reject when there is no danger to police or bystanders, and the suspect is compliant. But police do it routinely, and are rarely sanctioned for it.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSome of this undoubtedly stems from the fact that popular culture has turned tasering into slapstick comedy. Movies and TV shows and countless Youtube videos portray it as a hilarious joke. \"Don't tase me bro\" became as national catch phrase. But it's not funny. Tasers can kill people. And regardless of what level of respect and compliance one thinks police are entitled to get from the public, they are not entitled to torture and punish citizens to teach them a lesson.\n\nWalter Scott ran from the pain of the taser and he was shot in the back numerous times for doing it. Francis Pusok was compliant and was tasered and beaten repeatedly anyway. It appears that such shootings and beatings, when captured on film anyway, are still considered beyond the pale in America these days. In both cases, officers will have to face some sanction for their behavior. Slager is facing a murder charge. It's unknown what the California cops will face, but the FBI is investigating, so there may be some federal civil rights charges. It will be very interesting if any of the officers are charged with assault for using the taser. Let's just say it will be among the vast minority of cases ever brought if they are.",

         "NEW YORK ( ███ ) - Support for U.S. President Donald Trump increased slightly among Republicans after he lashed out on Twitter over the weekend in a racially charged attack on four minority Democratic congresswomen , a ███/Ipsos public opinion poll shows .\nThe national survey , conducted on Monday and Tuesday after Trump told the lawmakers they should “ go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came , ” showed his net approval among members of his Republican Party rose by 5 percentage points to 72 % , compared with a similar poll that ran last week .\nTrump , who is seeking re-election next year , has lost support , however , with Democrats and independents since the Sunday tweetstorm .\nAmong independents , about three out of 10 said they approved of Trump , down from four out of 10 a week ago . His net approval - the percentage who approve minus the percentage who disapprove - dropped by 2 points among Democrats in the poll .\nTrump ’ s overall approval remained unchanged over the past week . According to the poll , 41 % of the U.S. public said they approved of his performance in office , while 55 % disapproved .\nThe results showed strong Republican backing for Trump as the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives passed a symbolic resolution on Tuesday , largely along party lines , to condemn him for “ racist comments ” against the four Democratic lawmakers .\nAll four U.S. representatives - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , Ilhan Omar of Minnesota , Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan - are U.S. citizens . Three were born in the United States .\nThe public response to Trump ’ s statements appeared to be a little better for him than in 2017 , after the president said there were “ very fine people ” on both sides of a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville , Virginia .\nIn that instance , Trump ’ s net approval dropped by about 10 points a week after the Charlottesville rally .\nThis time , while Democrats and some independents may see clear signs of racial intolerance woven throughout Trump ’ s tweets , Republicans are hearing a different message , said Vincent Hutchings , a political science and African-American studies professor at the University of Michigan .\n“ To Republicans , Trump is simply saying : ‘ Hey , if you don ’ t like America , you can leave , ” Hutchings said . “ That is not at all controversial . If you already support Trump , then it ’ s very easy to interpret his comments that way . ”\nBy criticizing liberal members of the House , Trump is “ doing exactly what Republicans want him to do , ” Hutchings said . “ He ’ s taking on groups that they oppose . ”\nThe ███/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English and gathered responses from 1,113 adults , including 478 Democrats and 406 Republicans in the United States . It has a credibility interval , a measure of precision , of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 points for Democrats or Republicans .",

According to the poll, 41% of the U.S. public said they approved of his performance in office, while 55% disapproved.\n\nThe results showed strong Republican backing for Trump as the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives passed a symbolic resolution on Tuesday, largely along party lines, to condemn him for “racist comments” against the four Democratic lawmakers.\n\nAll four U.S. representatives - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan - are U.S. citizens. Three were born in the United States.\n\nThe public response to Trump’s statements appeared to be a little better for him than in 2017, after the president said there were “very fine people” on both sides of a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nIn that instance, Trump’s net approval dropped by about 10 points a week after the Charlottesville rally.\n\nThis time, while Democrats and some independents may see clear signs of racial intolerance woven throughout Trump’s tweets, Republicans are hearing a different message, said Vincent Hutchings, a political science and African-American studies professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 16, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\n“To Republicans, Trump is simply saying: ‘Hey, if you don’t like America, you can leave,” Hutchings said. “That is not at all controversial. If you already support Trump, then it’s very easy to interpret his comments that way.”\n\nBy criticizing liberal members of the House, Trump is “doing exactly what Republicans want him to do,” Hutchings said. “He’s taking on groups that they oppose.”\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English and gathered responses from 1,113 adults, including 478 Democrats and 406 Republicans in the United States. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 points for Democrats or Republicans.",

         "Six bullets . More than I can count on one hand . That is how many times preliminary autopsy reports indicate that Michael Brown was shot . Nothing about the youthful infraction of strolling down the middle of a residential street in one ’ s own neighborhood justifies having your life ripped away from you by an irate officer firing six bullets as you face him , hands up in surrender .\nI can not even fathom what Mike , “ Big Mike ” as his friends call him , felt as each of those bullets entered his flesh . I do know a little of the rage , despair , helplessness and hopelessness that black communities have been left to feel in the aftermath of his death . I know he stayed conscious long enough to put his hands up , to try and surrender , as if to say , “ I want to live . Please don ’ t kill me . ”\nFerguson residents and protesters now find themselves arms outstretched , palms up , yelling “ don ’ t shoot , ” as police officers in guns , gas masks and tanks occupy the streets of Ferguson , Missouri , dropping canisters of tear gas on our American dreams . Those of us not yet there in Ferguson watch helplessly as the images of at least one child being tear-gassed come through our Twitter feeds , as journalists find themselves facing down the barrel of a hastily drawn police weapon or thrown in jail , as police drop stun grenades on crowds that refuse to comply with the unreasonable demand that they relinquish their right to peaceful assembly .\nWhile the world watches aghast , America ’ s penchant for exporting guns , tanks and destruction to other places in the name of law and order has shown up on our own doorsteps , in our backyards , with people pinned into parking lots and onto their porches . They are told they must stay where they are or risk being shot with rubber bullets or have their faces and lungs sting with the inhalation of tear gas .\nPublic space in Ferguson is awash in black tears , but it is the sirens that we hear wailing . The people would weep , but they are too busy running , ducking and taking cover from the angry sounds of a system that does not love them , does not care about their meager “ rights . ”\nMeanwhile , the government attempts to placate the people with optical sleights of hand . Capt . Ron Johnson , by all accounts a sincere and affable leader and head of the highway patrol , replaced the police chief late last week , with promises that he would not employ military tactics to police the citizens of Ferguson . On Thursday I breathed a bit easier as we watched him giving hugs to protesters , marching with the people , allowing black women of faith to lay hands on him and pray .\nThat peace was short-lived after the Ferguson police inflamed crowds by releasing irrelevant footage of a conflict that Michael Brown had at a local convenience store when he and his friend Dorian went to buy Cigarellos . Late that evening the crowds returned , only to be met by more tanks , more tear gas , more guns .\nBeyond shock , I continue to be appalled at the extensive lengths to which the police have gone to protect Officer Darren Wilson and his family from any public reproach or reprisal in Mike ’ s death . They delayed the release of his name in order to provide him enough time to leave town . They then released his name to coincide with video of the Cigarello incident , which they later admitted he knew nothing about when he stopped Mike . It is clear that the police are closing ranks , showing that they value the lives of their own more than the lives of citizens .\nWe are told repeatedly that police are worthy of our respect because they risk their lives each day to protect us . That is not the case for black people . When we encounter police , our lives are at risk while they protect themselves . I started to temper my statement by saying “ some police , ” but that gives the impression that I am speaking of the actions of a few rogue officers . The problem with this logic is that we now know that Ferguson law enforcement has a range of problems – disproportionate stops of black residents , disproportionately low numbers of black police ( three out of over 50 ) , and a history of antagonistic exchanges with the people of St. Louis County .\nWe have a problem of overzealous policing in this country . That problem is exacerbated by issues of race and gender , so that black men are perceived to be far more threatening than they actually are . And when black women encounter police , we are not given the protections generally afforded to white femininity . Our womanhood does not mitigate the threat of police force . This , then , is not about the actions of a rogue officer , but rather about the ideology of overpolicing that deputizes extrajudicial behavior as completely justified , as long as the life being taken or haphazardly handled is a black or brown life . Though the killing of Brown by Wilson seemingly fits a long historical script of the harassment of black people at the hands of white police officers , the reality is that overpolicing is an ideology that many police officers subscribe to regardless of color .\nThat ideology is rooted in a kind of anti-blackness that sees black bodies as a perpetual and mortal threat . Anti-black rhetoric has shown up not only from the Ferguson police but also ironically in the reporting and advocacy of everyone from CNN reporter Don Lemon to rapper Nelly , in their continued focus on issues like “ black-on-black crime ” and the necessity of keeping law and order . “ Don ’ t use your last option , first , ” Nelly told folks on St. Louis radio . There is little recognition that it is Darren Wilson who used his last option – lethal force — first . Moreover , the whole point of using tear gas and military vehicles in this small community is to force the residents into a realization that they have run out of options . Sadly , anti-black ideology can emerge even from people who are black or who otherwise love black people .\nI know Americans like to see themselves as a law and order people , but the few folks who have rioted and looted over the last few days , many of whom are reportedly not Ferguson residents , were stopped in their tracks by peaceful protesters . Even still their presence exposes an inconvenient truth . The killing of unarmed teenagers by police officers is lawlessness . It shows a lack of respect for the sanctity of life and the rule of law . The supreme irony is seeing folks defend the officer ’ s lawlessness while calling for people destroying property to respect the law .\nAs I keep saying , destruction of property is not particularly productive . But I refuse to direct my ire toward anyone but the officer who unjustly took Michael Brown ’ s life and the police establishment that is now complicit in this crime .\nI am tired . Emotionally exhausted , actually . I am tired of going to sleep each night seeing a community of people who look like me under military siege . I ’ m tired of seeing crying black mothers – Sybrina Fulton , Lucia McBath and Leslie McSpadden —distraught over the loss of their teenage sons Trayvon , Jordan and Michael . I ’ m tired of hearing report after report of people under attack from tear gas . I ’ m tired of journalists being bullied for trying to tell the truth . I ’ m tired of explaining to white people why our anger is justified , why looting , which is a property crime , should not even be part of a conversation about the killing of a teenager , why the alleged shoplifting of cigarettes is not a capital offense , why the police officer who killed Mike for the crime of walking in the street is the real thug .\nWhite racism and white privilege continue a bad cop-good cop routine with black America that is utterly exhausting . Just when we think we are making headway , a well-meaning white person asks “ but can ’ t we condemn the looting too ? ” The question is : Have you condemned the killing ? Or have you tried to explain it away ? To justify it ?\nI will not engage in a condemnation quid pro quo with trolls , well-meaning white citizens or respectable black ones , “ Brand New Negroes ” I call them , in the tradition of the famous text from Harlem Renaissance philosopher Alain Locke . I will not concede that destruction of property is equal to the taking of life . I will not answer calls to be reasonable in the face of unreasonable , unjustifiable black death . I will not believe the lie that black propriety and respectability – pulling our pants up , speaking corporate English , never , ever doing anything wrong – will save us .\nFerguson exposes the extent to which American necropolitics shapes the terms and conditions of black life in what professor Sundiata Cha-Jua calls a new racial nadir . The first racial nadir happened from about 1890 to about 1930 , when black people experienced the unprecedented loss of political gains hard won in the aftermath of the Civil War and the astronomical rise of lynching . We have indeed reached a new nadir in America ’ s racial life , one hard to fathom as a black president sits in the White House , abdicating his responsibility to speak forcefully and forthrightly to the problem of racism and military-style policing both for fear of being seen as too “ black ” and for fear of political reprisal from the right .\nMeanwhile , our voting rights have been stripped away , our kids are being killed in the streets , their killers rarely convicted , and our communities are placed under siege .

Zhang is a permanent U.S. resident .\nProsecutors also said they found documents from several of Chen ’ s former employers at his second home in Maryland . They found a 2011 document from Raytheon Co. that they later determined was classified as “ confidential . ”\n“ This document contains information relating to Raytheon ’ s work on the Patriot Missile program and was not ( and is not ) permitted to be maintained outside of Department of Defense secured locations , ” prosecutors wrote . A hearing on the case is scheduled for February .\nChen and Zhang ’ s case comes as lawmakers and government officials worry China is stealing U.S. technology . Republican Sen. Josh Hawley , for instance , introduced legislation in June seeking to prevent American researchers from using technologies developed by Chinese big tech companies .\nUniversities are “ key targets of espionage and intellectual property theft by not only China , but Russia and Iran , ” the Missouri Republican said in a statement announcing the bill . “ For too long , these countries have sent students to our universities to collect sensitive research that they can later use to develop capabilities that threaten our national security . ”\nHawley introduced a bill in May that would force President Donald Trump to restrict technology to China that would contribute to the country ’ s military . That bill would also place heavy restrictions on technology that influences artificial intelligence , semiconductors , and robots .",

They found a 2011 document from Raytheon Co. that they later determined was classified as “confidential.”\n\n“This document contains information relating to Raytheon’s work on the Patriot Missile program and was not (and is not) permitted to be maintained outside of Department of Defense secured locations,” prosecutors wrote. A hearing on the case is scheduled for February.\n\nChen and Zhang’s case comes as lawmakers and government officials worry China is stealing U.S. technology. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, for instance, introduced legislation in June seeking to prevent American researchers from using technologies developed by Chinese big tech companies.\n\nUniversities are “key targets of espionage and intellectual property theft by not only China, but Russia and Iran,” the Missouri Republican said in a statement announcing the bill. “For too long, these countries have sent students to our universities to collect sensitive research that they can later use to develop capabilities that threaten our national security.”\n\nHawley introduced a bill in May that would force President Donald Trump to restrict technology to China that would contribute to the country’s military. That bill would also place heavy restrictions on technology that influences artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and robots.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

         "In an extensive article published last month that included interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement officials , congressional officials and other government employees , the New York Times published a stinging indictment of James B. Comey ’ s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe .\nThe Times made the case that Comey violated FBI tradition , bypassed the Justice Department and went rogue on several occasions in a manner that clearly impacted the 2016 presidential election .\nIn a letter on Tuesday from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired , Rosenstein specifically cited Comey ’ s alleged mishandling of the Clinton email probe as justification for Comey ’ s removal from office .\n“ I can not defend the Director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of secretary Clinton ’ s emails , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ And I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken . Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes ; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives . ”\nRosenstein continued : “ The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General ’ s authority on July 5 , 2016 , and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution . It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement . At most , the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors . ”\nThat is precisely the case made by the Times ’ April 22 article , titled , “ Comey Tried to Shield the F.B.I . From Politics . Then He Shaped an Election . ”\nThe Times says that for its article it interviewed “ more than 30 current and former law enforcement , congressional and other government officials . ”\nThe newspaper concluded that Comey ’ s decision to inform Congress that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email probe less than two weeks before the presidential election “ violate [ ed ] the policies of an agency that does not reveal its investigations or do anything that may influence an election . ”\nThe article related that Comey decided to plunge the FBI “ into the molten center of a bitter election ” in part because he feared “ the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I . had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret . ”\nA significant motivating factor for Comey ’ s rogue approach toward the Clinton email probe , the Times revealed , was his distrust of senior officials at the Justice Department , especially then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch , whom , the newspaper reported , “ Mr . Comey believed had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation . ”\nIndeed , according to the Times , Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Hillary Clinton in the email probe .\nThe FBI had further information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence , leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the U.S. government ’ s Clinton email probe , the Times reported .\nIn his letter from Tuesday , Rosenstein argues that if Comey believed Lynch to be compromised he should have sought her recusal instead of taking matters into his own hands .\n“ The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Lynch had a conflict , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department . There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General . ”\nIndeed , according to the Times , after it became clear that the F.B.I . did not discover Clinton emails showing intent to mishandle classified information – the agency believed those emails were among the correspondence deleted by Clinton – Comey made the decision to bypass the Justice Department and explain the case to the public .\nNine months into the investigation , it became clear to Mr. Comey that Mrs. Clinton was almost certainly not going to face charges . He quietly began work on talking points , toying with the notion that in the midst of a bitter presidential campaign , a Justice Department led by Democrats may not have the credibility to close the case , and that he alone should explain that decision to the public .\nComey ’ s decision was further fueled by the alleged document written by a Democratic operative hacked by the Russians , a document that in Comey ’ s view raised “ questions about [ Lynch ’ s ] independence , ” the Times reported .\nInstead of seeking Lynch ’ s recusal , as Rosenstein would later outline as the proper course of action , Comey decided to go at it alone , take matters into his own hands and make his public pronouncements about Clinton ’ s email case without the Justice Department .\nThe Times cited former Justice officials as “ deeply skeptical ” of Comey ’ s alleged reasoning :\nFormer Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account . If Mr. Comey believed that Ms. Lynch were compromised , they say , why did he not seek her recusal ? Mr. Comey never raised this issue with Ms. Lynch or the deputy attorney general , Sally Q. Yates , former officials said .\nMr. Comey ’ s defenders regard this as one of the untold stories of the Clinton investigation , one they say helps explain his decision-making . But former Justice Department officials say the F.B.I . never uncovered evidence tying Ms. Lynch to the document ’ s author , and are convinced that Mr. Comey wanted an excuse to put himself in the spotlight .\nComey ’ s decision to go rogue was solidified , according to the Times ’ account , after Lynch ’ s infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton , the husband of the FBI ’ s main subject in a criminal probe , boarded the attorney general ’ s plane and reportedly stayed there for about twenty minutes .\nYet Comey still did not seek Lynch ’ s recusal . The Times article related that after the tarmac episode , Comey “ knew for sure that when there was something to say about the case , he alone would say it . ”\nAfterwards , Comey held the press conference at which he criticized Clinton ’ s private email server as “ extremely careless ” before finally stating that “ no charges are appropriate in this case . ”\nWith his pronouncements , Comey offered judgments and legal conclusions many argue are out of the purview of the FBI , which is charged with documenting the evidence and handing it over to the Justice Department .\nThe Times cited unnamed “ frustrated ” prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them .\nComey ’ s injection into the presidential race did not end there . Less than two weeks before the election , the FBI discovered a trove of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of long-time top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin . Some of the emails , according to reports , originated on Clinton ’ s old BlackBerry server that she used before setting up her private home server and some believe may have contained the deleted messages .\nComey ’ s decision centered on whether to follow FBI tradition and keep quiet about the reopening of the case , or inform Congress about the ongoing investigation , which , the Times related , “ everyone acknowledged would create a political furor . ”\nEventually , Comey decided to go rogue again and inform Congress .\nLynch was against the decision , the Times reported , and the Justice Department implored the FBI not to impact the presidential campaign in its final days . The Times reported that “ even at the F.B.I. , agents who supported their high-profile director were stunned . ”\n“ Career prosecutors and political appointees ” at the Justice Department quietly criticized not only Comey but Lynch for failing to stop the FBI director , the Times documented .\nA chorus of former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from across the political spectrum publicly criticized Comey ’ s move . For example , Jamie S. Gorelick , who served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration , opined that Comey was “ damaging our democracy . ”\nWriting in the Washington Post on October 29 , Gorelick slammed Comey ’ s decision to so publicly reopen the case just before the election as “ antithetical to the interests of justice , putting a thumb on the scale of this election and damaging our democracy . ”\nGorelick co-authored the Washington Post opinion piece , titled , “ James Comey is damaging our democracy , ” with Larry Thompson , who served under the George W.

         "“ Trump has betrayed the Syrian Kurds ” — so goes a popular refrain regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the areas of northeast Syria held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) . The events that have followed — namely , a Turkish invasion of parts of SDF territory along the border and the deployment of Syrian government forces in some SDF areas — have been characterized as a strategic disaster for American interests , with some commentators even proclaiming the withdrawal as indicative of a U.S. imperial decline and U.S. disengagement from the Middle East .\nIn fact , much of this is overblown . For one thing , the U.S. still maintains extensive troop deployments elsewhere in the Middle East , and those are not being drawn down anytime soon . Insofar as many of the pundits , analysts , and policymakers condemning Trump consider the recent developments in Syria to be a disaster , they primarily have themselves to blame , however popular bashing Trump might be .\nIndeed , these critics of Trump did not learn the relevant lessons from December 2018 when the president ordered preparations for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria . They should have appreciated that Trump is ultimately the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces and that he had made his own preferences on Syria clear : namely , that after the military defeat of the Islamic State , U.S. forces should leave . As the president ’ s record on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal illustrates , he has generally been forthright and sincere in trying to fulfill his policy promises . When he told his advisers that he wanted to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria , he meant it . The message should have been clear : devise an orderly withdrawal plan .\nBut that is not what happened . Instead , efforts and attention were geared towards U.S. forces remaining indefinitely in Syria . The advocates for this “ stay indefinitely ” approach argued that the deployment as it existed was supposedly an example of a successful projection of U.S. leverage and influence with a relatively small number of troops . They claimed that U.S. presence was vital for political negotiations on Syria ’ s future and important for limiting Iranian influence and blocking its “ land route ” to the Mediterranean .\nIn reality , none of these assertions holds up but rather reflect dubious expansions of the original purpose of the U.S. mission in Syria : countering the Islamic State . At the same time , the “ stay indefinitely ” crowd tended to downplay the major problem regarding the U.S. partnership with the SDF : the issue of relations with Turkey , which considers ( with some justification ) the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , which has fought the Turkish state for decades .\nRegardless of what one thinks of Turkey ’ s approach towards the PKK , it is not a problem that can be treated as a minor irritant . Facts of geography mean that Turkey is located along the northern borders of the SDF ’ s territory . As such , Turkey could be the SDF ’ s main gateway to the outside world , rather than the small and limited capacity border crossing on the Tigris River that the SDF has maintained with the Iraqi Kurdistan region .

This view is implausible . A small foreign troop presence can function as a deterrent to another side ’ s attack , but it is not an absolute deterrent here . To understand why , consider events that occurred earlier this year on the other side of Syria . In the northwest of Syria ( specifically the city of Idlib and its environs ) , Turkey set up multiple small military outposts in the insurgent-held areas ostensibly as part of enforcing a “ deescalation ” scheme in coordination with Russia . In practice , the goal has been to block any further Syrian government offensives on the northwest and prevent further refugee flows into Turkey .\nWhile Russia has shown some understanding of Turkey ’ s concerns in this regard , it also wishes to assist the Syrian government in restoring its control over the area and will not tolerate the indefinite presence of designated “ terrorist ” groups harassing Syrian government and Russian positions . Russia thus gave Turkey time to clear a demilitarized buffer zone of the likes of Hay ’ at Tahrir al-Sham ( a designated “ terrorist ” group ) . When that did not materialize and the insurgent harassments of Syrian government and Russian positions continued , the Syrian government and Russia launched a military campaign that retook important areas in south Idlib and north Hama . The Turkish military outposts did not do anything to stop the offensive ( indeed , they could not do so ) , and in effect the Syrian government and Russia worked around one of the outposts in north Hama . A ceasefire then followed , but it should be clear that it will not last if Turkey can not crack down on the groups that are designated as “ terrorist . ”\nThat episode should also have been a lesson for U.S. policymakers . Turkey ’ s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly said he would launch an incursion against the SDF to the east of the Euphrates River ( where U.S. forces in Syria have primarily been stationed ) , and in 2018 Turkey had carried through with its threats to destroy the SDF enclave in the Afrin area , where the U.S. had no presence . What would have stopped Turkey from finding ways to work around U.S. positions as part of its incursion against the SDF east of the Euphrates River and essentially forcing the small U.S. garrisons — confronted by much larger Turkish forces and their Syrian insurgent proxies — to get out of the way ?\nThus , Trump ’ s indication to Erdoğan that he wished to leave Syria and would not oppose an incursion likely hastened the Turkish operations against the SDF . But it was not the decisive factor in determining whether or not those operations would have eventually occurred anyway . Had the U.S. wished to deter Turkey indefinitely , it would have had to deploy far more troops in northeast Syria . For comparison , the much more extensive Turkish military presence in the insurgent-held north Aleppo countryside between Afrin and Jarabulus functions as an effective deterrent against Russian and Syrian government military action so long as Turkey maintains that large presence .\nOf course , the advocates of the “ stay indefinitely ” course did not dare to confront these realities and argue for a more extensive U.S. presence , knowing that such advocacy would be politically unacceptable . They preferred to argue that the small U.S. troop presence in northeast Syria as an example of a deployment that was strategically effective and inexpensive .\nUltimately , the debate about the U.S. role in Syria boils down to the question of how far the U.S. should invest troops and resources into a foreign deployment . Those who advocated an indefinite presence are delusional if they think the prior status quo was sustainable . If they had thought more carefully about the idea of making the SDF-held areas a U.S. protectorate that could function independently of the wider environment , they should have accepted that such a project would have required far more troops and money to be poured in .\nIn any case , they should still be asked why they did not come up with an exit plan but instead thought they could defy the president ’ s wishes .

         "“Trump has betrayed the Syrian Kurds” — so goes a popular refrain regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the areas of northeast Syria held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The events that have followed — namely, a Turkish invasion of parts of SDF territory along the border and the deployment of Syrian government forces in some SDF areas — have been characterized as a strategic disaster for American interests, with some commentators even proclaiming the withdrawal as indicative of a U.S. imperial decline and U.S. disengagement from the Middle East.\n\n\n\nIn fact, much of this is overblown. For one thing, the U.S. still maintains extensive troop deployments elsewhere in the Middle East, and those are not being drawn down anytime soon. Insofar as many of the pundits, analysts, and policymakers condemning Trump consider the recent developments in Syria to be a disaster, they primarily have themselves to blame, however popular bashing Trump might be.\n\nIndeed, these critics of Trump did not learn the relevant lessons from December 2018 when the president ordered preparations for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria. They should have appreciated that Trump is ultimately the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces and that he had made his own preferences on Syria clear: namely, that after the military defeat of the Islamic State, U.S. forces should leave. As the president’s record on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal illustrates, he has generally been forthright and sincere in trying to fulfill his policy promises. When he told his advisers that he wanted to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, he meant it. The message should have been clear: devise an orderly withdrawal plan.\n\nBut that is not what happened. Instead, efforts and attention were geared towards U.S. forces remaining indefinitely in Syria. The advocates for this “stay indefinitely” approach argued that the deployment as it existed was supposedly an example of a successful projection of U.S. leverage and influence with a relatively small number of troops. They claimed that U.S. presence was vital for political negotiations on Syria’s future and important for limiting Iranian influence and blocking its “land route” to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn reality, none of these assertions holds up but rather reflect dubious expansions of the original purpose of the U.S. mission in Syria: countering the Islamic State. At the same time, the “stay indefinitely” crowd tended to downplay the major problem regarding the U.S. partnership with the SDF: the issue of relations with Turkey, which considers (with some justification) the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought the Turkish state for decades.\n\nRegardless of what one thinks of Turkey’s approach towards the PKK, it is not a problem that can be treated as a minor irritant. Facts of geography mean that Turkey is located along the northern borders of the SDF’s territory. As such, Turkey could be the SDF’s main gateway to the outside world, rather than the small and limited capacity border crossing on the Tigris River that the SDF has maintained with the Iraqi Kurdistan region. Thus, for the interests of the SDF’s longterm economic prospects (among other things), some kind of détente or resolution of the conflict between the PKK and Turkey would have been necessary so that the region could have much more open borders and engagement with the outside world.\n\nUnfortunately, though, policymakers and advisers did not take Turkey’s concerns and its threats of a military confrontation with the SDF seriously enough. Along with their desire to keep U.S. troops in Syria, many of them imagined that Turkey could somehow be appeased through half-baked measures: thus the previous attempts to deny SDF–PKK links, the failed schemes of joint U.S.–Turkish patrols in the Manbij area west of the Euphrates River, and then the joint northern border patrols and partial dismantling of SDF fortifications along the northern border with Turkey a little while before the recent Turkish incursion against the SDF.\n\nOthers argue that the U.S. simply needed to be adamant in saying no to a Turkish incursion and that the small U.S. troop presence could have deterred Turkey indefinitely. This view is implausible. A small foreign troop presence can function as a deterrent to another side’s attack, but it is not an absolute deterrent here.

         "Overruling objections by everyone from Indiana business leaders to actor George Takei , GOP Gov . Mike Pence on Thursday signed legislation that will allow individuals and businesses in the state to deny services to LGBT people on `` religious liberty '' grounds .\n`` The Constitution of the United States and the Indiana Constitution both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion , but today , many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action , '' Pence said in signing the law .\nAlthough Pence , a fervent social conservative , had signaled earlier this week that he would sign the legislation , LGBT rights advocates hoped to derail it with a last-ditch pressure campaign . Leading corporations in the state -- including Salesforce and Cummins -- came out against the measure , arguing that sanctioning anti-LGBT discrimination would damage the state 's reputation and its ability to recruit a talented workforce .

         "Overruling objections by everyone from Indiana business leaders to actor George Takei, GOP Gov. Mike Pence on Thursday signed legislation that will allow individuals and businesses in the state to deny services to LGBT people on \"religious liberty\" grounds.\n\n\"The Constitution of the United States and the Indiana Constitution both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion, but today, many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action,\" Pence said in signing the law.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAlthough Pence, a fervent social conservative, had signaled earlier this week that he would sign the legislation, LGBT rights advocates hoped to derail it with a last-ditch pressure campaign. Leading corporations in the state -- including Salesforce and Cummins -- came out against the measure, arguing that sanctioning anti-LGBT discrimination would damage the state's reputation and its ability to recruit a talented workforce. Takei, meanwhile, vowed to boycott the upcoming GenCon gaming convention in Indianapolis if Pence signed the legislation, and GenCon's CEO warned the governor that the legislation \"will factor into our decision-making on hosting the convention in the state of Indiana in future years.\"\n\nThe Disciples of Christ, a liberal denomination, joined the outcry, declaring that it would relocate its General Assembly, which was slated to be held in Indianapolis in 2017.\n\nThe legislation Pence signed bars states and localities from \"substantially burdening\" individuals' religious freedoms in the absence of a compelling government interest. Lawmakers throughout the country have proposed such \"religious liberty\" measures with the intent of allowing business owners and individuals to discriminate against LGBT people on religious grounds.\n\nLaws like Indiana's promise to serve as rallying cries for the religious right in the years to come, as conservatives grapple with the imminence of nationwide marriage equality and seek other ways to undermine legal protections for the LGBT community.

         "Jim Acosta of CNN and other media personalities get exercised when the President calls Fake News the “ enemy of the people. ” President Trump does not call all news outlets or personalities by that term — only the Fake News . Certainly , that term is quite an incendiary sobriquet . The President reciprocates with it because he gets attacked with incendiary abuse . No American President in memory has been picked on and lied about with the intensity and frequency that President Trump has had to endure .\nThe media — because it is almost-monolithically Left-Democrat — regularly depicted Ronald Reagan as a moron , occasionally tying him to a movie in which he acted , Bedtime for Bonzo , where he went to bed in one scene alongside a chimpanzee . ( They forget that he was cast in the film as a university professor . ) Reagan endured it , avoided reciprocal name-calling , and history unequivocally has registered that he actually was quite brilliant , understood what so many others could not grasp , revived the moribund Jimmy Carter economy with creative strategies and tax-cutting boldness that George H.W . Bush myopically had called “ Voodoo Economics , ” stared down Mikhail Gorbachev and defeated a century of Communism , and launched an anti-ballistic military focus that his enemies mocked as “ Star Wars ” but that today is central to protecting Western democracies from incoming ballistic missiles . The “ Iron Dome ” missile-defense system that Israel has used so effectively against Gaza Hamas terrorist rockets is the fruit of “ Star Wars . ”\nThe Left Media almost universally depicted the brilliant Reagan as an idiot , and he somehow shrugged it off . Donald Trump is different because we do not manufacture our Presidents with interchangeable parts on an assembly line . It very well may be that the past week ’ s Pittsburgh terrorist attack , and the way the President responded , and the way the Left Media then hit the President viciously anyway is the “ Rosetta Stone ” — the small piece of archaeological evidence historians will need — to decipher that Donald Trump was right to call the Fake News Left Media the “ enemy of the people . ”\n1 . “ The People ” Benefit From a Robust and Independent Press — and a Fake News Regime Indeed Is the Enemy of the People\n“ The People ” indeed benefit from a robust “ press ” — more accurately called “ media ” in this digital age of televised news , digital internet-based news , and so much more than the mere newsprint “ press. ” If Stalin ’ s Soviet Russia had been covered by a robust media ( and if such media could have survived ) , “ The People ” would have learned that Stalin ’ s five-year economic plans disastrously were failing and were leading to mass starvation , moreover that he consciously was perpetrating genocide by starving millions of Ukrainians to death in the Golodomor , that he was putting millions of prisoners to work in tundra prisons to dig through ice manually to build canals and other infrastructure . An honest news media would have alerted the West , too , that Stalin was murdering millions . The New York Times had a sycophantically pro-Stalin liar , Walter Duranty , filing Fake News reports from the Soviet Union for more than ten years . The Times published the lies daily as “ news ” and made him their Moscow bureau chief for fourteen years . As a result , the West was lulled , cheated of the truth , made unaware of the evil . Yes , the Fake News indeed was the enemy of the people .\nLikewise , the New York Times— and the other mainstream media who took their lead from them — by and large refused to report on the unfolding Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews . Between 1939 and 1945 , the New York Times published more than 23,000 front-page stories . Of those , 11,500 were about World War II . Only twenty-six — in six years — were about the Holocaust . The Times was passively complicit .\nA robust newsmedia can save lives by exposing and revealing , while a Fake News regime can serve to assist in the despoiling of a people . When media foist false narratives to sow social discord , or when they assist tyranny with falsehoods , they indeed are the enemy of the people .\nSocial discord leads to streets being set on fire — witness Ferguson and Baltimore during the Obama Years . Social discord dispirits potentially valuable citizens who could help build a society , instead turning them against that society and motivating them to work towards its downfall or simply to drop out . In its worst aspect , social discord leads to armed insurrection and civil war . If the problem is that a Stalin is murdering millions by deliberately starving them while incarcerating millions others in slave camps in the Gulag , then insurrection and civil war can be righteous , potentially saving such a despoiled society . But when the society actually is doing quite well , when freedom reigns and people of all colors , creeds , religions , and ethnicities are enjoying remarkable opportunities to succeed and to live wonderfully rich and precious lives alongside their neighbors in respectful diversity , then Fake News media indeed are the enemy of the people when they seek to sow social discord in that welcome environment , aiming to up-end civil harmony .\nA maniacal dirtbag murdered eleven Jews in Pittsburgh . In time , perhaps after a decade or two of ACLU appeals , he will be electrocuted , injected , hanged , or hopefully all three . The dirtbag hated Jews , and he likewise hated President Trump . President Trump responded to the news immediately with profoundly sensitive and healing words aimed at condemning anti-Semitism and at comforting and consoling the Jewish community . Listen to his words . If the role of a President is to heal and unify , as President Reagan did after the Challenger tragedy , as President Bush did after 9-11 , then this President did so eloquently , sensitively . And then came the sowers of social discord to destroy the moment… .\nThe Left Media would not allow the President that moment to heal and unify . Instantly , they brought in one Left-Democrat anti-Trump “ analyst ” after another to blame Mr. Trump for the attack . They never blamed President Jimmy Carter ’ s anti-Jewish rhetoric for the 1977 Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue shooting in St. Louis . Nor Bill Clinton for the 1994 Brooklyn Bridge shootings of yeshiva students that included the murder of Ari Halberstam . Nor Clinton ’ s rhetoric for the 1999 Granada Hills Jewish Community Center shooting in Los Angeles . Nor Obama for the deadly 2009 Holocaust Museum shooting in Washington , D.C . Nor Obama for the 2014 Overland Park Jewish Community Center shootings in Kansas City that murdered three . But this time — with the same social dynamics as the others — they tried blaming the President . By sowing social discord with outright absolute falsehoods at a time that called for healing , the Left Media indeed were acting as enemy of the people .\nFacts are different from opinions . Facts can be discerned and evidenced . There is a reason that as many as 82 percent of Israeli Jews love President Trump , that more than 90 percent of American Orthodox Jews support President Trump . Likewise , a huge majority of British Jews — by more than three-to-one — support England ’ s conservative party and despise the Labour Socialists . Similarly , millions of Jews who have left the former Soviet Union hate Marxism and socialism , are solidly capitalist and conservative , indeed have changed the face of Israeli politics towards the more conservative Likud , now led by Benjamin Netanyahu . Throughout the world , Jews now vote conservative , are conservative — as reflected in our country , too , by American Orthodox Jews . The independent Pew Research Center has found that the Orthodox Jewish community will be the predominant Jewish community in a few decades , as the others disappear . Just as the voting patterns of the American Deep South have changed 180 degrees from Democrat to Republican in the century since the Civil War , so is the American Jewish metamorphosis now on pace to synchronize with every other Jewish community in the world that has moved towards conservatism . But Jews are not monolithic , as witness those in Hollywood and in certain media .\nSo look at what the Fake News Left Media did after President Trump healed and unified : They received a news release from a small , utterly insignificant , nothing of a Radical Leftist group , calling itself “ Bend the Arc , ” which said that they did not want the President of the United States to visit Pittsburgh . The thing is , those Radical Leftists do not want the President to visit anywhere . Just as there are rabid Leftist Catholics ( not to mention the more mainstream Leftist Nancy Pelosi , Joe Biden , and the Kennedys ) and rabid Leftist Protestants , these also are rabid Leftists . Within the normative mainstream American Jewish community , “ Bend the Arc ” is a joke , off the charts . Their CEO started off as a sex-club “ dancer. ” C ’ mon ! As reported : “ Cotler , who identifies as queer , recounted how a lesbian couple invited her to their [ event ] after she did a table dance for them at what she refers to as a ‘ sex club. ’ ” Feh !\nSo this Leftist fringe group issues their statement — and the Fake News Left Media then falsely report that “ the Jews of Pittsburgh ” ( not “ some Jews ” ) do not want the President to visit . Consider these headlines — and they are a mere sampling :\n“ ‘ You Are Not Welcome ’ : Jewish Community Leaders Do Not Want President Trump To Come To Pittsburgh ” ( Salon )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Stay Away Unless He Denounces White Nationalism ” ( NY Daily News )\n“ Trump ‘ Not Welcome ’ In Pittsburgh After Synagogue Shooting ” ( Al Jazeera )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Denounce White Nationalism ” ( Reuters )\nAll those stories thereupon cite the same insignificant radical-fringe “ Bend the Arc ” statement . Honestly — if there still is such a thing as honesty — that is outright Fake News . I know the American Jewish community . I have been a Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America , a congregational rabbi for decades , sat for six years during this past decade on the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America , have sat on committees of Jewish Federations and Boards of Hillels , have a whole lifetime résumé in this area . My rabbinical colleagues and I were bristling all day , reading and hearing this Fake News . The rabbi of the temple where the murders happened , Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers , explicitly welcomed a visit by the President . To report such lies , at a time of such intense passion , is to stoke flames among the populace . It is not unfair to call such liars “ Enemies of the People . ”\nThey do it similarly to convince Americans of Color that this President hates them . He beams so proudly that he has helped reduce poverty and unemployment in the African-American community . Likewise , in the Latino and Greater Hispanic communities . It is a hallmark of his every speech . How compare him to Hitler , for G-d ’ s sakes ? Why sow social discord between and among races when the President , despite his classical Trumpian gaffes , actually takes so much pride in his being a President for all Americans , in a country where — in his trademark line — “ we all bleed the same red , white , and blue ” ? Why denigrate his outreach to Black Americans , whether via Kanye West and Jim Brown or by speaking to a Young Black Leadership Summit ? Why begin narrating his Presidency on Day One by reporting falsely , as Zeke Miller of Time magazine did , the lie that he had removed a bust of the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office ? Why publish falsehoods to sow discord among the Black and Latino communities — if not to aim cynically to peel away their votes — by trying falsely to report that he is a bigot who hates them ? Here is a man who was in the public eye , in the world ’ s media center in the heart of Manhattan , with a weekly network television show , building skyscrapers and hotels , golf courses and casinos — all bearing his name — and no stain of racism or bigotry of such sort ever got attached to him through all those decades in the limelight . Why cause enmity and divide the nation , disillusion African Americans and Latinos from recognizing that this President seeks their advancement alongside that of everyone else ? Only to sow civil discord , to promote tension and unrest in the name of advancing an agenda that assures greater television ratings , higher advertising dollars , and a change in the elected government chosen of The People , by The People , and for The People .\n3 . The Proof the Pudding : Tagging the Most Pro-Jewish President in American History as an Anti-Semite .\nSo it comes back to the Rosetta Stone — the way the Left Media falsely portrays this President ’ s relationship with one demographic , the Jews , demonstrating a pattern of Left Media mendacity aimed at sowing social discord throughout . Even before he was elected President , the Left Media was calling him an anti-Semite by clutching at straws to prove the false narrative . Just as they did by propping up “ Bend the Arc ” into a Fake News depiction as “ Jewish Leaders , ” they regularly dig up the most irrelevant and unrepresentative people from the Far Left who are JINOs— Jews In Name Only — as “ experts ” on Trump and anti-Semitism . It does not end . These are lies , damned lies , and more damned lies being perpetuated by enemies of the people . Just consider these facts about the Trump Administration and the Jews :\nThis is an anti-Semite ? If so , may G-d smite us with an abundance of such anti-Semites ! Although his daughter , Ivanka , and son-in-law Jared Kushner are Orthodox Jews — as are their children , his grandchildren — that family connection in itself is not determinative . After all , we are told that George Soros is a Jew , and most every Jew I know would gladly trade Soros for two anti-Semites and a neo-Nazi to be named later . Soros is a major opponent of Israel and secretly funds organizations that oppose critical Israel policies . But the demonstrated life record of President Trump , a lifetime of working closely with Jews , amicably and warmly , makes him someone whom Jews throughout the world appreciate deeply . Again — every survey and poll of Jews who actually live the Jewish observances , the kosher laws , the Sabbath , the Torah demonstrates that he is warmly regarded in that community .\nThe Fake News about Trump and Jews is the Rosetta Stone . Once one cracks that hidden code , everything else becomes clear . The Left Media indeed propound Fake News , lies , and falsehoods . They undertake to stoke anger among African Americans , among Latinos , among women . The People rely on them for the news , the truth — and , yes , for honest reporting when the President is wrong because The People benefit when they are told the truth , even when the truth is not pretty . But to depict him as an agent of Putin , as a man perpetrating treason , a hater ?\nThese are the lies that come only from Enemies of the People .",

Nor Obama for the 2014 Overland Park Jewish Community Center shootings in Kansas City that murdered three. But this time — with the same social dynamics as the others — they tried blaming the President. By sowing social discord with outright absolute falsehoods at a time that called for healing, the Left Media indeed were acting as enemy of the people.\n\nFacts are different from opinions. Facts can be discerned and evidenced. There is a reason that as many as 82 percent of Israeli Jews love President Trump, that more than 90 percent of American Orthodox Jews support President Trump. Likewise, a huge majority of British Jews — by more than three-to-one — support England’s conservative party and despise the Labour Socialists. Similarly, millions of Jews who have left the former Soviet Union hate Marxism and socialism, are solidly capitalist and conservative, indeed have changed the face of Israeli politics towards the more conservative Likud, now led by Benjamin Netanyahu. Throughout the world, Jews now vote conservative, are conservative — as reflected in our country, too, by American Orthodox Jews. The independent Pew Research Center has found that the Orthodox Jewish community will be the predominant Jewish community in a few decades, as the others disappear. Just as the voting patterns of the American Deep South have changed 180 degrees from Democrat to Republican in the century since the Civil War, so is the American Jewish metamorphosis now on pace to synchronize with every other Jewish community in the world that has moved towards conservatism. But Jews are not monolithic, as witness those in Hollywood and in certain media.\n\nSo look at what the Fake News Left Media did after President Trump healed and unified: They received a news release from a small, utterly insignificant, nothing of a Radical Leftist group, calling itself “Bend the Arc,” which said that they did not want the President of the United States to visit Pittsburgh. The thing is, those Radical Leftists do not want the President to visit anywhere. Just as there are rabid Leftist Catholics (not to mention the more mainstream Leftist Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, and the Kennedys) and rabid Leftist Protestants, these also are rabid Leftists. Within the normative mainstream American Jewish community, “Bend the Arc” is a joke, off the charts. Their CEO started off as a sex-club “dancer.” C’mon! As reported: “Cotler, who identifies as queer, recounted how a lesbian couple invited her to their [event] after she did a table dance for them at what she refers to as a ‘sex club.’” Feh!\n\nSo this Leftist fringe group issues their statement — and the Fake News Left Media then falsely report that “the Jews of Pittsburgh” (not “some Jews”) do not want the President to visit. Consider these headlines — and they are a mere sampling:\n\n“‘You Are Not Welcome’: Jewish Community Leaders Do Not Want President Trump To Come To Pittsburgh” (Salon)\n\n“Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Stay Away Unless He Denounces White Nationalism” (NY Daily News)\n\n“Trump ‘Not Welcome’ In Pittsburgh After Synagogue Shooting” (Al Jazeera)\n\n“Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Denounce White Nationalism” (Reuters)\n\nAll those stories thereupon cite the same insignificant radical-fringe “Bend the Arc” statement. Honestly — if there still is such a thing as honesty — that is outright Fake News. I know the American Jewish community. I have been a Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America, a congregational rabbi for decades, sat for six years during this past decade on the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America, have sat on committees of Jewish Federations and Boards of Hillels, have a whole lifetime résumé in this area. My rabbinical colleagues and I were bristling all day, reading and hearing this Fake News. The rabbi of the temple where the murders happened, Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers, explicitly welcomed a visit by the President. To report such lies, at a time of such intense passion, is to stoke flames among the populace. It is not unfair to call such liars “Enemies of the People.”\n\nThey do it similarly to convince Americans of Color that this President hates them. He beams so proudly that he has helped reduce poverty and unemployment in the African-American community. Likewise, in the Latino and Greater Hispanic communities. It is a hallmark of his every speech. How compare him to Hitler, for G-d’s sakes? Why sow social discord between and among races when the President, despite his classical Trumpian gaffes, actually takes so much pride in his being a President for all Americans, in a country where — in his trademark line — “we all bleed the same red, white, and blue”? Why denigrate his outreach to Black Americans, whether via Kanye West and Jim Brown or by speaking to a Young Black Leadership Summit? Why begin narrating his Presidency on Day One by reporting falsely, as Zeke Miller of Time magazine did, the lie that he had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office? Why publish falsehoods to sow discord among the Black and Latino communities — if not to aim cynically to peel away their votes — by trying falsely to report that he is a bigot who hates them? Here is a man who was in the public eye, in the world’s media center in the heart of Manhattan, with a weekly network television show, building skyscrapers and hotels, golf courses and casinos — all bearing his name — and no stain of racism or bigotry of such sort ever got attached to him through all those decades in the limelight. Why cause enmity and divide the nation, disillusion African Americans and Latinos from recognizing that this President seeks their advancement alongside that of everyone else? Only to sow civil discord, to promote tension and unrest in the name of advancing an agenda that assures greater television ratings, higher advertising dollars, and a change in the elected government chosen of The People, by The People, and for The People.\n\n3. The Proof the Pudding: Tagging the Most Pro-Jewish President in American History as an Anti-Semite.\n\nSo it comes back to the Rosetta Stone — the way the Left Media falsely portrays this President’s relationship with one demographic, the Jews, demonstrating a pattern of Left Media mendacity aimed at sowing social discord throughout. Even before he was elected President, the Left Media was calling him an anti-Semite by clutching at straws to prove the false narrative. Just as they did by propping up “Bend the Arc” into a Fake News depiction as “Jewish Leaders,” they regularly dig up the most irrelevant and unrepresentative people from the Far Left who are JINOs— Jews In Name Only — as “experts” on Trump and anti-Semitism. It does not end. These are lies, damned lies, and more damned lies being perpetuated by enemies of the people. Just consider these facts about the Trump Administration and the Jews:\n\nThis is an anti-Semite? If so, may G-d smite us with an abundance of such anti-Semites! Although his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner are Orthodox Jews — as are their children, his grandchildren — that family connection in itself is not determinative. After all, we are told that George Soros is a Jew, and most every Jew I know would gladly trade Soros for two anti-Semites and a neo-Nazi to be named later. Soros is a major opponent of Israel and secretly funds organizations that oppose critical Israel policies. But the demonstrated life record of President Trump, a lifetime of working closely with Jews, amicably and warmly, makes him someone whom Jews throughout the world appreciate deeply. Again — every survey and poll of Jews who actually live the Jewish observances, the kosher laws, the Sabbath, the Torah demonstrates that he is warmly regarded in that community.\n\nThe Fake News about Trump and Jews is the Rosetta Stone. Once one cracks that hidden code, everything else becomes clear. The Left Media indeed propound Fake News, lies, and falsehoods. They undertake to stoke anger among African Americans, among Latinos, among women. The People rely on them for the news, the truth — and, yes, for honest reporting when the President is wrong because The People benefit when they are told the truth, even when the truth is not pretty. But to depict him as an agent of Putin, as a man perpetrating treason, a hater?\n\nThese are the lies that come only from Enemies of the People.",

         "Last week , Creshuna Miles , Juror No . 8 in the Michael Dunn trial , gave an interview to CNN about the jury ’ s partial verdict . Although she believes that Michael Dunn is guilty of second-degree murder , a lesser charge for which the jury had the option to convict , she insisted that the case was “ not about race , ” that it never came up . Moreover , she believed Michael Dunn to be essentially “ a good guy , ” who made “ bad choices . ”\nStartlingly , she also indicated that until Dunn ran down the street chasing Jordan ’ s three friends , she actually believed that Dunn acted in self-defense .\nPost-racial thinking is insidious not only because it gives lie to the very real and continuing material consequences of racism in this country , but also because it seduces young , optimistic , idealistic black youth into identifying with the very systems and people who would kill them without a second thought -- and then go order a pizza and a take a nap .\nPart of what Miles ’ impressions of Dunn reveal is that the defense did a far better job of humanizing Dunn for the jury than the prosecution did of humanizing Jordan for the jury .\nBut her impressions also reveal a deep disidentification with the seemingly retrograde racial politics that informed Dunn ’ s fatal engagement with Jordan Davis . Those 20th century-style racial politics take as a given that a group of young black men listening to rap music must be up to no good and that white harm is imminent .\nSuch thinking seems not to fit the cosmopolitan , progressive 21st century narrative of multiracial acceptance that ideological post-racialism pretends to be .\nI know that jury selection is a strategy . And I know Creshuna Miles was picked because she is a black woman whose political views seem to be able to lay race to the side , even when it is so glaringly obvious .\nHad Jordan Davis been white , he would still be alive . Maybe Michael Dunn would have yelled at a white Jordan Davis for bumping rap music , but he absolutely would not have perceived such a kid to be a threat or the playing of rap music loud enough to constitute a capital offense .\nCreshuna Miles came to a right decision , and wanted to convict Michael Dunn of some form of murder . But her fervent belief that the case was “ about justice , ” not “ about race , ” misses a fundamental truth about American society . Justice and injustice in this country are inextricable from racial politics . Racial politics determine everything from who gets arrested to who gets convicted , the harshness of the sentences they ’ ll serve , and the quality of legal representation they ’ ll have .\nMoreover , Creshuna Miles is not just a black woman . She is a big , dark-skinned black woman , who rocks honey blond highlights in her hair . Her unmistakable , inescapable , culturally ethnic blackness is part of the unspoken but visual narrative of this trial . Just as Michael Dunn came upon a car and visually assessed threat based upon the color of the young men inside , the visuality of Creshuna Miles ’ body absolutely influences how her testimony is understood .\nIn some ways Miles is a perfect foil for Rachel Jeantel . In Jeantel ’ s post-Zimmerman trial interview , she discounted a juror who claimed race hadn ’ t mattered in the trial , telling Piers Morgan , “ Let ’ s be honest . It ’ s racial. ” In this case , Creshuna Miles , just one year older than and visually similar to Rachel , comes along and says just the opposite . In both cases , black America saw the bodies of these two women and cringed . Internalized self-hatred coupled with violent conditions for black men is always a dangerous brew for black women . So I have been less compelled to jump on the `` critique Creshuna '' bandwagon , because so much of it is rooted in the unreasonable expectations that we have for black women to know how to outwit a system that is designed to work against not just black men , but us , too . Still I see Rachel and Creshuna and a certain knowing emerges for me .\nI know that when you live your life in an unmistakably big black body , of the type that Rachel , Creshuna and I share , a body that is often seen as aggressive and threatening , two types of coping strategies emerge . One is a kind of aggressive embrace of one ’ s own blackness and a refusal to take any shit . That seems like how Rachel rolls . The other relies on a rejection of the truth about race as a form of triumph over the impenetrability of racial discourse . In other words , maybe Creshuna Miles felt more intelligent and progressive , by taking a contrarian position , by not holding the views that people assumed that she , as a black person , would hold .\nGiven her particular kind of black embodiment , Creshuna Miles ’ decision carries great weight in an American populace that deeply wants to believe in the myth of a colorblind system . The problem here – the lie of post-racialism , to be more precise – is that Miles ’ rejection of the racial elements of this case hold more weight precisely because she is a black woman . Essentially , finding the biggest and blackest of black women to say that there was no miscarriage of justice in this case helps assuage any white guilt .\nI ’ m not angry with Creshuna Miles . But I know her thinking , uninformed as it is , is dangerous . I know the justice system relies on the willing racial performativity of black people who are willing to discount the importance of race in matters such as these . Much like patriarchy requires the complicity and willing participation of women to continue , racism requires the complicity and willing , if unwitting , participation of black and people of color to continue .\nI ’ m deeply bothered by the fact that she does not seemingly understand the way in which her body was used against her . That she felt compelled as a black woman in the case to come out and insist on all the ways that it wasn ’ t about race suggests how deeply it is about race . Florida ’ s justice system pimped Creshuna Miles for her body type and flawed perspective . Her identification with Dunn is the flip side of the same kind of logic that got Trayvon and Jordan killed . She failed to recognize that she was on the jury and appealing to the media precisely because she reads as everything Dunn is not . She might see the justice system as colorblind , but it absolutely would not see her in the same ways . Everyone sees her color . By the same token , Trayvon , Jordan , Rachel and even Marcus Smart all believed they could engage white people who approached them combatively on equal or similar terms .\nWhen Zimmerman confronted and questioned Trayvon , Trayvon talked back and then fought back . When the Zimmerman defense team goaded Rachel Jeantel on the stand , she served up a healthy helping of visible disdain . When Michael Dunn confronted Jordan and his friends , they all verbally resisted his “ instruction ” and command that they turn down the music .\nThese young black folks have not fully reckoned with what it means to occupy a completely different social position than the white people who confronted them and demanded various forms of compliance . One set of social positions has legal protection and the right to armed self-defense . The other social position requires deference and the eschewing of all aggression in order to be believed and protected – and in order to stay among the living .\nJordan , Trayvon and Rachel never perfected the fine art of respectable resistance . And because I am deeply resistant to respectability politics on principle , I ’ m not sure they should . But the death and tragedy these young people have endured reminds me of why our ancestors frequently turned to respectable forms of resistance as a form of survival .\nWhen I look at Creshuna Miles , it is clear to me that her racial analysis is far more akin to that of her peers than different . All of these young people want to believe that they have the right to assert themselves and their rights and priorities in the same ways that white men retain the prerogative to do . Through the most brutal of lessons , they continue to learn differently .\nI hope Creshuna Miles learns differently . I remind myself that she is only 21 and that she did vote to convict . But racial innocence won ’ t serve her well . I hope she knows that she was chosen as a juror because of the combination of her black body and her whitewashed racial views , not despite them .

         "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on , though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question . So now , in order to preserve the broader framework — in which , for example , that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order , and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley .\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position , and the temporizing of others around her , I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done . There is still fierce opposition in some nearby quarters to what she has done , and she showed some degree of moral leadership when she called for state law to be quickly changed , so that the battle flag could be taken down . Yet , it ’ s equally clear that she has framed her argument well within the historical tradition of Southern white supremacist ideology — not in the heart of that tradition , to be sure , but still within the stifling folds of its garments .\nFor many people in our state the flag stands for traditions that are noble — traditions of history , of heritage , and of ancestry . The hate-filled murderer who massacred our brothers and sisters in Charleston has a sick and twisted view of the flag . In no way does he reflect the people in our state who respect and in many ways revere it . Those South Carolinians view the flag as a symbol of respect , integrity and duty . They also see it as a memorial , a way to honor ancestors who came to the service of their state during time of conflict . That is not hate . Nor is it racism .\nIn short , Dylann Roof messed things up for all the rest of us , so — unfortunately — things have to change . Implicitly , that ’ s the real bottom line . Haley continued , with a brief nod to the obvious , before hurrying on :\nAt the same time , for many others in South Carolina , the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past . As a state , we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints . We do not need to declare a winner and a loser here .\nAnd so she declared a truce — the truce of false equivalency — as the pathway forward :\nWe respect freedom of expression . And that for those who wish to show their respect for the flag on their private property , no one will stand in your way . But the statehouse is different . And the events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way .\nThe willingness to change is easy to grab onto and praise , but the more troubling aspects , the multiple ways in which change — not to mention simple justice — are more challenging to properly grasp , identify and name , much less come to terms with . At least three starting points can easily be identified , however . The first came from Ta-Nehisi Coates . Honing in on the underlying claim that Roof 's views did not reflect those of South Carolinians more broadly , Coates quickly weighed in to say :\nIf the governor meant that very few of the flag ’ s supporters believe in mass murder , she is surely right . But on the question of whose view of the Confederate Flag is more twisted , she is almost certainly wrong . Roof ’ s belief that black life had no purpose beyond subjugation is “ sick and twisted ” in the exact same manner as the beliefs of those who created the Confederate flag were “ sick and twisted. ” The Confederate flag is directly tied to the Confederate cause , and the Confederate cause was white supremacy .\nThis is the plain historical reality , and Coates goes on to rolls out stanza after stanza in an impressive historical litany of authoritative voices repeatedly underscoring the point , beginning with the Confederate states ’ own explanations for war , starting with South Carolina , then Mississippi ( which was particularly blunt : “ Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world. ” ) , Louisiana , Alabama ( “ the election of Mr. Lincoln can not be regarded otherwise than … an open declaration of war ” ) and Texas .\nHe then goes on to quote notable individuals , such as Jefferson Davis , not only affirming the centrality of slavery to the Southern cause , but elaborating on their desire to extend slaveholding into Cuba , Mexico and elsewhere , as well as propounding their belief that the equality of white men was founded on the slavery of blacks , and thus would be irrevocably lost if slavery were to be abolished . Thus , white supremacy for the South was not simply an isolated belief in the inherent superiority of whites as a race , it was the foundation for an aggressive and self-styled “ progressive ” worldview , a whole self-contained system of thought . The flag is inextricably linked to all of that .\nAs a second starting point it ’ s also true that the Confederate battle flag was largely a relic until it was revived in response to the Civil Rights Movement — first with Strom Thurmond ’ s “ States Rights Party ” in 1948 , then with Georgia adopting a version in protest of Brown v. Board of Education in 1956 , and South Carolina six years later — though , tellingly , the flag went up a year before the act authorizing it . For almost a hundred years , the South got on just fine celebrating its heritage without benefit of the flag . Indeed , the flag was raised over South Carolina as a result of the Civil War centennial celebration . This revival of interest in the flag was clearly all about renewed defiance of the federal government , which was finally being prodded into making good on the Civil War Amendments , and ensuring the full citizenship of African-Americans . Hence , today , the “ heritage ” the flag actually stands for is that of the 1960s , not the 1860s . Good luck with that .\nA third , related point , made by Jeet Heer at the New Republic , is that the flag matters tremendously as exertion of raw power . Its reintroduction in response to the Civil Rights movement sent a clear message : “ The feds might try to help you , but remember who is the boss down here . We still rule. ” Flying everywhere throughout the South , it sends the constant message to black Southerners , that they are not safe , they are not in control of their own personal security , much less anything else . Whatever other stories Southern whites might tell themselves and others about the flag , this basic fact remains . Indeed , the rhetorical act of denying the flag ’ s white supremacist meaning only demonstrates further how completely whites control things .\nBeyond these three starting points , there ’ s a vast terrain to explore , in terms of the white supremacist legacy the flag stands for and how it has reshaped itself over time . There are at least four key elements that any such account would have to explore . First , is the matter of white supremacy itself as a matter of organized social policy — both in terms of what it supports ( slavery in one era , segregation in the next , etc . ) and what it opposes ( abolition , integration , “ big government ” ) — as well as the culture it both depends upon and reproduces . Second , is the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to another , both establishing purportedly new foundations , while simultaneously reinterpreting the past .\nIt originally expressed itself in terms of slavery , then segregation and now largely in terms of what sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva described as “ colorblind racism ” in his book `` Racism Without Racists : Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America . '' Third , is the way in which white supremacy naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against . Bonilla-Silva ’ s book has a great deal to say about this as well . Furthermore , the pretense that the battle flag represents Civil War-era heritage rather than Civil Rights-era hatred is a telling example of how this process unfolds . Fourth , is the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance , etc . Haley leaned very heavily on this aspect of white supremacy in the process of pretending to reject it . So let us briefly consider each of these in turn .\nFirst , let ’ s reflect on white supremacy as a matter of organized social policy . There is nothing particularly difficult for people today to look back on past forms of white supremacy and reject them . It ’ s easy nowadays to see slavery or segregation as evil . Even Rand Paul , defending segregation in principle , said it was a bad business decision . But what about white supremacy policies today ?\nWhile part of the impetus to remove the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina came from respect for the Rev . Clementa Pinckney , the long-serving , highly respected member of the South Carolina State Senate , this only scratched the surface of Pinckney ’ s politics , as pointed out by North Carolina NAACP leader the Rev . William Barber on Democracy Now ! recently :\nReverend Pinckney , as a colleague in ministry , was not just opposed to the flag , he was opposed to the denial of Medicaid expansion , where now the majority of the state is opposing Medicaid expansion where six out of 10 black people live . He was opposed to voter suppression , voter ID in South Carolina . He was opposed to those who have celebrated the ending of the Voting Rights Act , or the gutting of Section 4 , which means South Carolina is no longer a preclearance state , and the very district that he served in is vulnerable right now . He was opposed to the lack of funding for public education . He wanted to see living wages raised .\nEvery item Barber mentioned is felt more deeply by the black community , so it ’ s not hard to grasp what a true rejection of white supremacy would look like . One might say that this calls for “ activist government , ” but the white South was all in favor of activist government `` When Affirmative Action Was White , '' as Ira Katznelson ’ s 2006 book explained . Thus , Barber continued :\nSo I would say to my colleagues , let ’ s take down the flag — to the governor — but also , let ’ s put together an omnibus bill in the name of the nine martyrs . And all of the things Reverend Pinckney was standing for , if we say we love him and his colleagues , let ’ s put all of those things in a one big omnibus bill and pass that and bring it to the funeral on Friday or Saturday , saying we will expand Medicaid to help not only black people , but poor white Southerners in South Carolina , because it ’ s not just the flag . Lee Atwater talked about the Southern strategy , where policy was used as a way to divide us . And if we want harmony , we have to talk about racism , not just in terms of symbol , but in the substance of policies . The flag went up to fight policies . If we ’ re going to bring it down , we ’ re also going to have to change policies , and particularly policies that create disparate impact on black , brown and poor white people .\nThe phrase “ disparate impact , ” which Barber used , is key to how white supremacy operates in the post-segregation era . It ’ s not that the races are treated entirely differently , only that the odds , burdens , privileges and benefits change , depending on the color of your skin . Often this happens without any conscious awareness , which is why Bonilla-Silva ’ s phrase , “ racism without racists ” is so apt . This is really not difficult to grasp — unless you ’ ve got a vested interest in not grasping it . In which case , welcome to the world of our second topic , the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to the next , and how\nTransitions between eras are often abrupt in some respects — the swift abolition of slavery in the final years of the Civil War , for example — while taking decades to work out in other ways . In order to first establish , and then fully stabilize the segregationist era , the meaning and purpose of the Civil War itself had to be reinterpreted through a white supremacist lens . The story of how that transpired over a fifty-year period is the subject of `` Race and Reunion : The Civil War in American Memory '' by David W. Blight . As I summarized in my review :\nBlight explains three broad visions of Civil War memory - reconciliationist , emancipationist and white supremacist . The first was born in wartime responses to its terrible brutality , epitomized by Walt Whitman 's experience of tending the wounded and dying of both sides . The second sprang not just from the war , but also from the Emancipation Proclamation and the more than 200,000 black combatants who joined the fight . The third gradually reformulated itself after the shock of military defeat , eventually dominating reconciliationist thinking by sacrificing racial reconciliation for the sake of sectional reunion .\nIt was not surprising that the reconciliationist view came to dominate — politically , materially , the nation needed sectional reintegration in a much more immediate way than it needed anything for its black citizens — a calculus that would eventually change over time . What ’ s striking is the relative ease with which the white supremacist vision came to merge with and dominate the reconciliationist view .\nThis is not the exception , but the rule in American history : any moves toward reconciling differences inevitably become infected with white supremacist aims — unless , of course , they are founded on them to begin with , as the case with American Colonization Society and the movement surrounding it , more on that below . A similar process has taken place with the end of segregation and the discrediting of overt racism which the norm in that era throughout the South , as well as in much of the North . This is essence of what Bonilla-Silva reveals in `` Racism Without Racists '' : a set of beliefs has emerged with superficially broad appeal , but which harbors a “ hidden ” white supremacist impact . Bonilla-Silva identifies four central frames at the core of colorblind racism : `` The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information , '' Bonilla-Silva writes . The first — and what I take to be the most significant and distinctive frame — is “ abstract liberalism , ” which he explains as follows :\nThe frame of abstract liberalism involves using ideas associated with political liberalism ( e.g . `` equal opportunity , '' the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy ) and economic liberalism ( e.g. , choice , individualism ) in an abstract manner to explain racial matters .\nWhat abstract liberalism hides is virtually everything having to do with history and indeed all social science , outside the narrow framework of market economics . It hides all historical inequalities , which recent research suggests persists for as long as ten generations . It also hides subconscious racial preferences , which can create intense segregation without any overt centralized coercion . But above all , it creates the illusion of some idealized social order , which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “ reverse racism. ” In short , the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them : they are the “ real racists , ” not whites !\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles , but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone . These are “ naturalization , ” which “ allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences , ” “ cultural racism ” which “ relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘ Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education ’ or ‘ blacks have too many babies ’ to explain the standing of minorities in society ” and “ minimization of racism ” which “ suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities ' life chances ( ‘ It 's better now than in the past ’ or ‘ There is discrimination , but there are plenty of jobs out there ’ ) . ” All three of these frames have been used in past eras . For example , Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past , so segregation was something blacks could and should accept . Similarly , cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism . But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today .\nAs I indicated above , not only does Bonilla-Silva ’ s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another , it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “ naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against. ” Indeed , this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “ common sense ” emerges , responding to multiple different needs at once , most typically , a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible , and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible . The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude , even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact . Meanwhile , those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order , even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics .\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic , the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance and so forth . It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else , and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done . Not only does white supremacy lay down the law , if conflicts arise in response , white supremacy takes the lead in naming , identifying and analyzing them , leading to proposed white supremacist solutions . On a macro scale , this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale , from the lowliest parts on up to the whole .\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society . It was originally founded to bring together two politically disparate groups , Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders , both united by the belief that free blacks faced a miserable future in America , and would be better off in Africa . This granddaddy of all “ grand bargains ” was laughable on its face — there hundreds of thousands of free blacks , far more than could ever be returned to Africa , even if they had all wanted to go — which most emphatically did not . But it was extremely popular with political elites , precisely because of its centrist power to “ bring people together ” — white people , that is . In his book , `` Of One Blood : Abolitionism and the Origins of Racial Equality , '' historian Paul Goodman had this to say :\nBy 1817 , African colonization had become more than a speculative idea . In the next decade , hundreds of prominent Americans -- political leaders including Presidents Madison and Monroe and religious leaders in most of the large denominations , from Presbyterian Lyman Beecher of Massachusetts to Episcopalian bishop William Mead of Virginia—threw their prestige and influence behind the America Colonization Society ( ACS ) , which established the colony of Liberia in West Africa . One of the most impressive voluntary societies of its day , the ACS boasted over two hundred state and local auxiliaries by 1830 . It was quietly assisted by President Monroe and endorsed by state legislatures and the major religious denominations , as well as by an illustrious panoply of notables .\nAs Goodman goes on to describe , the 19th-Century abolitionist movement was born out of free blacks ’ opposition to the ACS . It was precisely their unwillingness to be “ reasonable ” which formed the foundation of resistance which eventually spread to white abolitionists , and over a period five decades , eventually resulted in emancipation . Yet , almost up until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation he himself continued to be a supporter of colonization — such was the power of this “ centrist ” white supremacist vision . In fact , the ACS lived on for almost 100 years after Lincoln ’ s death — it only shut down in 1964 !\nThere are many other instances in which the cause of black freedom only advanced by refusing to be “ reasonable ” or to live up to some purported virtue or another . That ’ s because white supremacy , in one form or another , has always had such an enormous say in dictating what it meant to be “ reasonable ” or virtuous . And so it ’ s been incumbent on blacks to learn to think outside the box — to find a broader framework of understanding on which to found their moral as well as their political analysis .\nThis is why Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , once spoke to the American Psychological Association , and came out proudly for the cause of what he called “ creative maladjustment ” :\nI am sure that we will recognize that there are some things in our society , some things in our world , to which we should never be adjusted . There are some things concerning which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will . We must never adjust ourselves to racial discrimination and racial segregation . We must never adjust ourselves to religious bigotry . We must never adjust ourselves to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few . We must never adjust ourselves to the madness of militarism , and the self-defeating effects of physical violence… . Thus , it may well be that our world is in dire need of a new organization , The International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment .\nSimilarly , King ’ s “ Letter From Birmingham Jail ” was all about rejecting the framework of passive , superficial words of peace , moderation and restraint which the white ministers of Birmingham sought to impose on him . Here is just a small section of the wisdom it contains :\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress . I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace , in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight , to a substantive and positive peace , in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality . Actually , we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension . We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive . We bring it out in the open , where it can be seen and dealt with .\nI could not help myself thinking about the profound wrong-headed of “ reasonable ” white supremacy as I heard Nikki Haley ’ s speech , which is why my enthusiasm for it was so dimmed . In perhaps her most deeply typical move , she said there didn ’ t have to be winners and losers . Folks who love the flag and folks who despise it can all get along just fine ! But , of course , that leaves the entire substantive agenda Reverend Barber spoke about dead on arrival — just as it was supposed to do . There is no real underlying intent to address and disown the evil of white supremacy . The only way that evil is faced is by projecting it onto the disowned Confederate son , Dylann Roof .\nA good way to understand what ’ s wrong with Haley ’ s speech is to compare it with a speech by a quintessential white Southerner , Strom Thurmond ’ s son , whose speech makes no such attempt to defend the blind worship of “ heritage. ” Here is what South Carolina State Senator Paul Thurmond said :\nI am aware of my heritage . But my appreciation for the things that my forebearers accomplished to make my life better doesn ’ t mean that I must believe that they always made the right decisions and , for the life of me , I will never understand how anyone could fight a civil war based , in part , on the desire to continue the practice of slavery . Think about it for just a second . Our ancestors were literally fighting to continue to keep human beings as slaves and continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will . I am not proud of this heritage . These practices were inhumane and were wrong , wrong , wrong .\nWhere Haley felt the need to comfort — even identify with — those who see the flag as a symbol of noble heritage , Paul Thurmond simply said , “ I am not proud. ” Simple as that . A clean break . And that , my friends , is what America needs , where white supremacy is concerned . A clean break — and then the real business of a creating a livable future for all of us can begin .",
         "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on, though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question. So now, in order to preserve the broader framework — in which, for example, that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order, and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.\n\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position, and the temporizing of others around her, I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done.

Yet, it’s equally clear that she has framed her argument well within the historical tradition of Southern white supremacist ideology — not in the heart of that tradition, to be sure, but still within the stifling folds of its garments.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHere's Haley:\n\nFor many people in our state the flag stands for traditions that are noble — traditions of history, of heritage, and of ancestry. The hate-filled murderer who massacred our brothers and sisters in Charleston has a sick and twisted view of the flag. In no way does he reflect the people in our state who respect and in many ways revere it. Those South Carolinians view the flag as a symbol of respect, integrity and duty. They also see it as a memorial, a way to honor ancestors who came to the service of their state during time of conflict. That is not hate. Nor is it racism.\n\nIn short, Dylann Roof messed things up for all the rest of us, so — unfortunately — things have to change. Implicitly, that’s the real bottom line. Haley continued, with a brief nod to the obvious, before hurrying on:\n\nAt the same time, for many others in South Carolina, the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past. As a state, we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints.

The third gradually reformulated itself after the shock of military defeat, eventually dominating reconciliationist thinking by sacrificing racial reconciliation for the sake of sectional reunion.\n\nIt was not surprising that the reconciliationist view came to dominate — politically, materially, the nation needed sectional reintegration in a much more immediate way than it needed anything for its black citizens — a calculus that would eventually change over time. What’s striking is the relative ease with which the white supremacist vision came to merge with and dominate the reconciliationist view.\n\nThis is not the exception, but the rule in American history: any moves toward reconciling differences inevitably become infected with white supremacist aims — unless, of course, they are founded on them to begin with, as the case with American Colonization Society and the movement surrounding it, more on that below. A similar process has taken place with the end of segregation and the discrediting of overt racism which the norm in that era throughout the South, as well as in much of the North. This is essence of what Bonilla-Silva reveals in \"Racism Without Racists\": a set of beliefs has emerged with superficially broad appeal, but which harbors a “hidden” white supremacist impact. Bonilla-Silva identifies four central frames at the core of colorblind racism: \"The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information,\" Bonilla-Silva writes. The first — and what I take to be the most significant and distinctive frame — is “abstract liberalism,” which he explains as follows:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe frame of abstract liberalism involves using ideas associated with political liberalism (e.g. \"equal opportunity,\" the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy) and economic liberalism (e.g., choice, individualism) in an abstract manner to explain racial matters.\n\nWhat abstract liberalism hides is virtually everything having to do with history and indeed all social science, outside the narrow framework of market economics. It hides all historical inequalities, which recent research suggests persists for as long as ten generations. It also hides subconscious racial preferences, which can create intense segregation without any overt centralized coercion. But above all, it creates the illusion of some idealized social order, which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “reverse racism.” In short, the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them: they are the “real racists,” not whites!\n\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles, but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone. These are “naturalization,” which “allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences,” “cultural racism” which “relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education’ or ‘blacks have too many babies’ to explain the standing of minorities in society” and “minimization of racism” which “suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities' life chances (‘It's better now than in the past’ or ‘There is discrimination, but there are plenty of jobs out there’).” All three of these frames have been used in past eras. For example, Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past, so segregation was something blacks could and should accept. Similarly, cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism. But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today.\n\nAs I indicated above, not only does Bonilla-Silva’s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another, it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “naturalizes, normalizes and moralizes itself, so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify, much less name, and fight against.” Indeed, this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “common sense” emerges, responding to multiple different needs at once, most typically, a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible, and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible. The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude, even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact. Meanwhile, those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order, even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics.\n\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic, the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals, such bringing people together, establishing peace and harmony, promoting tolerance and so forth. It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else, and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done. Not only does white supremacy lay down the law, if conflicts arise in response, white supremacy takes the lead in naming, identifying and analyzing them, leading to proposed white supremacist solutions. On a macro scale, this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale, from the lowliest parts on up to the whole.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society. It was originally founded to bring together two politically disparate groups, Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders, both united by the belief that free blacks faced a miserable future in America, and would be better off in Africa. This granddaddy of all “grand bargains” was laughable on its face — there hundreds of thousands of free blacks, far more than could ever be returned to Africa, even if they had all wanted to go — which most emphatically did not. But it was extremely popular with political elites, precisely because of its centrist power to “bring people together” — white people, that is. In his book, \"Of One Blood: Abolitionism and the Origins of Racial Equality,\" historian Paul Goodman had this to say:\n\nBy 1817, African colonization had become more than a speculative idea. In the next decade, hundreds of prominent Americans--political leaders including Presidents Madison and Monroe and religious leaders in most of the large denominations, from Presbyterian Lyman Beecher of Massachusetts to Episcopalian bishop William Mead of Virginia—threw their prestige and influence behind the America Colonization Society (ACS), which established the colony of Liberia in West Africa. One of the most impressive voluntary societies of its day, the ACS boasted over two hundred state and local auxiliaries by 1830. It was quietly assisted by President Monroe and endorsed by state legislatures and the major religious denominations, as well as by an illustrious panoply of notables.\n\nAs Goodman goes on to describe, the 19th-Century abolitionist movement was born out of free blacks’ opposition to the ACS. It was precisely their unwillingness to be “reasonable” which formed the foundation of resistance which eventually spread to white abolitionists, and over a period five decades, eventually resulted in emancipation. Yet, almost up until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation he himself continued to be a supporter of colonization — such was the power of this “centrist” white supremacist vision. In fact, the ACS lived on for almost 100 years after Lincoln’s death — it only shut down in 1964!\n\nThere are many other instances in which the cause of black freedom only advanced by refusing to be “reasonable” or to live up to some purported virtue or another. That’s because white supremacy, in one form or another, has always had such an enormous say in dictating what it meant to be “reasonable” or virtuous. And so it’s been incumbent on blacks to learn to think outside the box — to find a broader framework of understanding on which to found their moral as well as their political analysis.\n\nThis is why Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once spoke to the American Psychological Association, and came out proudly for the cause of what he called “creative maladjustment”:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI am sure that we will recognize that there are some things in our society, some things in our world, to which we should never be adjusted. There are some things concerning which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will. We must never adjust ourselves to racial discrimination and racial segregation. We must never adjust ourselves to religious bigotry. We must never adjust ourselves to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. We must never adjust ourselves to the madness of militarism, and the self-defeating effects of physical violence…. Thus, it may well be that our world is in dire need of a new organization, The International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment.\n\nSimilarly, King’s “Letter From Birmingham Jail” was all about rejecting the framework of passive, superficial words of peace, moderation and restraint which the white ministers of Birmingham sought to impose on him. Here is just a small section of the wisdom it contains:\n\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with.\n\nI could not help myself thinking about the profound wrong-headed of “reasonable” white supremacy as I heard Nikki Haley’s speech, which is why my enthusiasm for it was so dimmed. In perhaps her most deeply typical move, she said there didn’t have to be winners and losers. Folks who love the flag and folks who despise it can all get along just fine! But, of course, that leaves the entire substantive agenda Reverend Barber spoke about dead on arrival — just as it was supposed to do. There is no real underlying intent to address and disown the evil of white supremacy. The only way that evil is faced is by projecting it onto the disowned Confederate son, Dylann Roof.\n\nA good way to understand what’s wrong with Haley’s speech is to compare it with a speech by a quintessential white Southerner, Strom Thurmond’s son, whose speech makes no such attempt to defend the blind worship of “heritage.” Here is what South Carolina State Senator Paul Thurmond said:\n\nI am aware of my heritage. But my appreciation for the things that my forebearers accomplished to make my life better doesn’t mean that I must believe that they always made the right decisions and, for the life of me, I will never understand how anyone could fight a civil war based, in part, on the desire to continue the practice of slavery. Think about it for just a second. Our ancestors were literally fighting to continue to keep human beings as slaves and continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will. I am not proud of this heritage. These practices were inhumane and were wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\nWhere Haley felt the need to comfort — even identify with — those who see the flag as a symbol of noble heritage, Paul Thurmond simply said, “I am not proud.” Simple as that. A clean break. And that, my friends, is what America needs, where white supremacy is concerned. A clean break — and then the real business of a creating a livable future for all of us can begin.",

It also took place in Hebrew , a language virtually none of the members of the Western press read or speak ; most simply took the Ha ’ aretz report and ran with it . Netanyahu was asked directly about whether his Bar-Ilan speech was “ irrelevant. ” Here is what Netanyahu actually said :\nNETANYAHU : I think anyone who is going to build a Palestinian state today will be freeing up space to give an attack area to radical Islam against Israel . This is the reality created here in recent years . Anyone who ignores this sticks his head in the sand . The left does this , burying its head in the sand again and again . We are realistic and understand… NRG : If you are elected head of state , no Palestinian state will come to fruition ? NETANYAHU : Indeed . NRG : Construction in Jerusalem and the West Bank will renew ? NETANYAHU : We are continuing all the time , but that ’ s not a question about additional building . There is a real threat that the government of the left will join the international community and do their bidding… .\nNetanyahu continued by arguing that the left would buy into the “ international initiatives to return to the 1967 borders and divide Jerusalem . ”\nIn other words , Netanyahu did not discount the possibility of a Palestinian state forever . He said that anyone who tries to build a Palestinian state “ hayom ” – “ today ” – would be giving territory to radical Islam . He even added that this was a reality created in recent years .\nTo read that as a wholesale rejection of a Palestinian state is to lie . Which is what Ha ’ aretz did . And the entire lazy and ridiculous world media followed . Netanyahu never flip-flopped , because Netanyahu never flipped .\nAnd Netanyahu ’ s policy is the exact same as the policy of the man who created the Oslo Accords , Yitzchak Rabin , who said just one month before his assassination in 1995 , “ We view a permanent solution [ involving ] a Palestinian entity which is less than a state… We will not return to the June 4 , 1967 lines… We committed ourselves before the Knesset not to uproot a single settlement in the framework of the interim agreement , and not to hinder building for natural growth… And first and foremost in our concerns is a united Jerusalem , as the capital of Israel , under Israeli sovereignty . ”\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of ███ and author of the new book , The People vs. Barack Obama : The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration ( Threshold Editions , June 10 , 2014 ) .

Netanyahu never flip-flopped, because Netanyahu never flipped.\n\nAnd Netanyahu’s policy is the exact same as the policy of the man who created the Oslo Accords, Yitzchak Rabin, who said just one month before his assassination in 1995, “We view a permanent solution [involving] a Palestinian entity which is less than a state… We will not return to the June 4, 1967 lines… We committed ourselves before the Knesset not to uproot a single settlement in the framework of the interim agreement, and not to hinder building for natural growth… And first and foremost in our concerns is a united Jerusalem, as the capital of Israel, under Israeli sovereignty.”\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the new book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).

         "Tomorrow morning , House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan will release the latest version of his budget blueprint , setting the federal government on a course to balance annual revenue and spending levels by the year 2023 .\nUntil now , the former Republican vice presidential nominee has never proposed a budget that balanced in just a decade .\n`` I would n't expect big surprises from us [ Tuesday ] . We 're making some additional modest changes to get to balance .

''\nWhile Ryan is the chief author of the GOP 's budget proposal , he does not work alone and there are varying perspectives .

''\nBut some GOP insiders confidentially question whether Ryan can pass his budget out of a committee markup this week . Republicans hold a narrow 22-17 seat advantage over Democrats on the committee .

''\nWhile Ryan would not elaborate on any details from his new budget ahead of Tuesday 's release , there are reports he could raise the threshold at which people are protected from changes to the Medicare eligibility age .\nOn the House floor , Republicans hold a 232-200 majority , plus there are three vacant seats . With 216 votes constituting a simple majority , House Speaker John Boehner and Ryan can lose just 16 rank and file Republicans . Last year 10 Republicans voted against the Ryan budget on the floor , but in the new session of Congress where the GOP 's majority is slimmer than the last session , Boehner has needed Democratic votes to pass several essential pieces of legislation .\nAt a pen and pad briefing last week , Ryan did his best to assure reporters that all Republican members on the committee are `` unified .

         "President Trump ’ s fiery response to the events in Charlottesville , Virginia , had a lot of media outlets and Democrats upset . Apparently , this also included Ivanka Trump and White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner — whose displeasure is regularly leaked to the media .\nThe New York Times ’ Glenn Thrush reported this week , via an anonymous source , that Kushner and Ms. Trump had urged the president to denounce the white nationalist protesters “ more forcefully. ” Thrush reported the news just after Trump had defended his recent statements .\n“ You look at both sides . I think there is blame on both on both sides . I have no doubt about it … if you reported it accurately , you would say that , ” Trump said to an angry media scrum .\nHowever , it isn ’ t the first time President Trump has upset his daughter and son-in-law –only for it to inexplicably find its way to the media . Here are five other times Trump has upset the power couple .\nWhen tapes emerged in October of President Trump talking crudely about women in 2005 was leaked to the Washington Post , it nearly derailed Trump ’ s campaign .

         "President Trump’s fiery response to the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, had a lot of media outlets and Democrats upset. Apparently, this also included Ivanka Trump and White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner — whose displeasure is regularly leaked to the media.\n\nThe New York Times’ Glenn Thrush reported this week, via an anonymous source, that Kushner and Ms. Trump had urged the president to denounce the white nationalist protesters “more forcefully.” Thrush reported the news just after Trump had defended his recent statements.\n\n“You look at both sides. I think there is blame on both on both sides. I have no doubt about it … if you reported it accurately, you would say that,” Trump said to an angry media scrum.\n\nHowever, it isn’t the first time President Trump has upset his daughter and son-in-law –only for it to inexplicably find its way to the media. Here are five other times Trump has upset the power couple.\n\nAccess Hollywood\n\nWhen tapes emerged in October of President Trump talking crudely about women in 2005 was leaked to the Washington Post, it nearly derailed Trump’s campaign. It also upset Ivanka Trump — who, according to the New York Times, ”made an emphatic case for a full-throated apology.”\n\n“[Trump’s] daughter’s eyes welled with tears, her face reddened, and she hurried out in frustration,” the Times reported in May.\n\nParis Climate Agreement\n\nWhen President Trump announced that the U.S. would pull back from the Paris climate agreement, it soon found its way to the media that Ivanka and Jared were not too pleased. Politico, while reporting that it was surely a “loss” for the happy couple, cited sources saying that the pair were taking it in their stride.\n\n“Their view of their roles in the White House is that they’re playing the long game, helping the president to be successful. And they don’t tally their own influence day by day or bill by bill,” the outlet reported.\n\nTrump ‘Undermines’ Kushner on Mexico\n\nAccording to high-society Vanity Fair in January, Kushner was “furious” that his efforts were being “undermined” by the President of the United States. The outlet pointed to a meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, which Kushner was trying to arrange.\n\nWhen Trump tweeted that it would be better to cancel the meeting if Mexico was unwilling to pay for the wall, the meeting was canceled.\n\nof jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2017\n\n“Kushner was fucking furious,” an anonymous source told the outlet. “I’d never once heard him say he was angry throughout the entire campaign. But he was furious.”\n\nJared and Ivanka Work to Kill LGBT Rights Order\n\nIn February, news reached Politico that the pair helped kill off an order that would have overturned a 2014 Obama-era executive order preventing LGBT discrimination in the workplace.\n\nThe White House downplayed the move, saying it was one of hundreds of draft orders being considered.\n\nTransgender Military Ban\n\nWhen President Trump tweeted that he would not allow trans-identifying people to serve in the military, a number of people within the White House were reportedly shocked. Again, it didn’t take long for news to hit mainstream media outlets that Kushner and Ms. Trump were shocked also.\n\nAccording to Politico, Kushner and Ms. Trump were “blindsided” by the tweet — with Ivanka reportedly learning of the decision “when she saw her father’s tweet on her phone.”\n\nAdam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

Congress and the White House reached a deal Tuesday that would provide another $ 310 billion .\nTo get the loans forgiven , companies need to spend 75 % on payroll within eight weeks of receiving the money . The other 25 % can be spent on rent , utilities , and mortgage payments . Otherwise , the loan has generous terms : Only a 1 % interest rate and six months before any principal is due .\nMany of the small companies that were able to obtain a loan are having second thoughts about rehiring all their workers and a few plan to return the money . Others will use what they can on rent and utilities , and will use some to rehire a portion of their laid-off staff . But most are unsure they will be able to reopen eight weeks from now . They see little point in rehiring all their workers , paying them to do little or nothing , and then potentially laying them off again if business remains weak two months from now .\n“ You ’ re turning the business into a pass through for the federal government , ” said Joe Walsh , who owns Clean Green Maine , a cleaning service in Portland , Maine with 35 employees . “ You ’ re doing very little to actually help the business . ”\nIt ’ s unclear how much the small business lending program can hold back the surge in joblessness — a record 22 million people sought unemployment aid in the past month .

Bank of America economists estimate that another $ 650 billion would be necessary to meet demand .\nAlso , the generous unemployment aid that was also included in the government ’ s relief package has made it more difficult to rehire . Many workers are making more with unemployment checks , which now include a $ 600 weekly benefit from the federal government .\nWalsh , who received a $ 280,000 loan from the SBA , said that he is reluctant to push his employees to return to work because , under unemployment benefit rules , they could lose their weekly checks if they turn down potential jobs .\n“ That ’ s just putting me as the employer in a really difficult position , ” Walsh said . He pays at least $ 17 an hour , with benefits , but his former employees are getting the equivalent of roughly $ 25 an hour from unemployment .\nRight now , Walsh ’ s business is closed due to lack of demand for cleaning services . He hopes to reopen soon and bring back some workers , retrain them on new sanitizing processes , and earn a bit of revenue . Still , he doubts his business will be anywhere close to what it was anytime soon , which means his workforce won ’ t be either .\n“ There ’ s no way that I ’ m getting to 100 % employment by the end of 8 weeks , ” he said .\nThe National Federation for Independent Business , a small business advocacy group , is pushing the government to make it easier for loans to be forgiven .\nThe group wants the SBA to eliminate the requirement that 75 % be spent on payroll , or at least reduce it to 50 % . It also wants the rehiring window extended beyond eight weeks and is pushing for a “ good faith ” provision that would credit companies for trying to rehire workers who prefer unemployment aid instead .\nThe NFIB also asked that half the next round of funding be reserved for businesses with fewer than 20 employees , to counter complaints that many large , publicly-traded companies obtained loans in the first round . The agreement reached late Tuesday did not make that change but directed some funds to smaller banks .\nAccording to a survey of its members , the NFIB said that just half of those who have applied for loans expect that they will rehire all their workers and get the entire amount forgiven . A quarter expect that at least three-quarters of the loan will be forgiven , while 15 % didn ’ t know .\nThe American Sustainable Business Council and several other small business groups are pushing to have the starting date for rehiring shifted from the date a company received a loan to the date it can legally reopen .

         "Socialists did not sweep the midterms . That is because it would have been mathematically impossible for socialists to sweep the midterms . For all the ink and pixels spilled , there were n't actually very many of them on the ballot . Forty-six Democratic Socialists of America ( DSA ) candidates won primaries in 2018 . Of those , 14 were backed by the national Democratic Party and only four were running for the U.S. House . Most prominent among them was New York 's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , who endorsed a few more candidates on her own as well .\nOcasio-Cortez won her congressional race in a landslide , as did Rashida Tlaib in Michigan . But DSA 's Sarah Smith was beaten out by Democrat Adam Smith in Washington 's unusual Smith vs. Smith congressional race , and James Thompson lost in Kansas to Republican budget hawk Rep. Ron Estes . Ocasio-Cortez fave Ayanna Pressley , a non-DSA progressive , did win in Massachusetts .\nIn short , no red tide hiding inside a blue wave swept over Capitol Hill . There are n't even many socialists warming statehouse backbench seats this winter—at press time only six additional DSA candidates had been declared victorious , alongside a handful of hyperlocal wins , such as for neighborhood commissions and boards of education .\nVoters are hardly going socialist either . DSA membership has grown from 7,000 to 50,000 since President Donald Trump was elected . But despite the prevalence of the red rose emojis that so-called New Socialists use to signal their allegiances on Twitter , and despite the ubiquity of Ocasio-Cortez 's red lipstick on cable news , those numbers are quite small . For perspective , the Libertarian Party has more than half a million registered voters .\nSocialists have not seized control of the country , but they did manage to grab a nice juicy handful of the debate . What was once the province of white-haired dead-enders has now become the primary source of fresh new ideas in American politics .\nAll of the major Democratic contenders for 2020 have floated at least one signature Sorta Socialist Policy Plank already . Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D–Mass . ) has a plan to aggressively regulate all corporations at the board level , plus a big subsidy for homebuyers in previously redlined neighborhoods called the American Housing and Mobility Act . Sen. Kamala Harris ( D–Calif . ) is offering a $ 500 monthly refundable tax credit to poor families with her Livable Incomes for Families Today ( LIFT ) Act , which is essentially the Earned Income Tax Credit on meth . She is also part of a Californian crossover initiative called Housing for All , which would involve aggressive subsidies for renters . Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D–N.Y . ) wants to turn the U.S. Post Office into a bank , while Sen. Cory Booker ( D–N.J . ) is offering `` baby bonds '' that would be funded by the government annually and mature when the carrier turns 18 .\nNone of these ideas is new—Hillary Clinton pushed a version of the baby bonds idea back in 2008—but they are newly appealing , thanks in large part to the surprising 2016 primary successes of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I–Vt . ) , who has been singing his old refrain of debt-free college and Medicare for All for decades .\nAstute readers might note that none of these proposals is actually socialism as it has historically been understood—or as it is currently being practiced in Venezuela , for that matter . The workers do not own the means of production . The economy is not ( very ) centrally planned . These are not transitional moves toward communism .\nAnd yet you may have seen the headlines last August—right around the time of Ocasio-Cortez 's primary victory in New York 's 14th Congressional District—claiming that Democrats now prefer socialism to capitalism for the first time , according to a Gallup poll . While this is technically true , it 's worth noting that this is the result of a dramatic decline in the popularity of capitalism , not a surge in support for socialism . The latter remains essentially unchanged overall . Even among young people , there is no discernible upward trend . ( There is an even more marked drop in support for capitalism among the young , however , including a 12-point fall in the last two years . )\nGallup does not define either term in its question . The `` Kids These Days Say They Like Socialism , but They Do n't Even Know What That Word Really Means '' article has become a media staple . Full disclosure : ███ has even run one or two essays along those lines . But what we talk about when we talk about socialism is n't actually nationalizing the means of production or centrally planning the economy . Sure , for a few diehards , it means replacing identity politics with class consciousness . But for most people , cheering socialism is merely a means for expressing discontent with the current capitalist system and a desire for ambitious public works and entitlement programs .\nIt 's totally fair to point out that Scandinavian-style redistribution of gains from a market economy is not , in fact , socialism .

         "Socialists did not sweep the midterms. That is because it would have been mathematically impossible for socialists to sweep the midterms. For all the ink and pixels spilled, there weren't actually very many of them on the ballot. Forty-six Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) candidates won primaries in 2018. Of those, 14 were backed by the national Democratic Party and only four were running for the U.S. House. Most prominent among them was New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who endorsed a few more candidates on her own as well.\n\nOcasio-Cortez won her congressional race in a landslide, as did Rashida Tlaib in Michigan. But DSA's Sarah Smith was beaten out by Democrat Adam Smith in Washington's unusual Smith vs. Smith congressional race, and James Thompson lost in Kansas to Republican budget hawk Rep. Ron Estes. Ocasio-Cortez fave Ayanna Pressley, a non-DSA progressive, did win in Massachusetts.\n\nIn short, no red tide hiding inside a blue wave swept over Capitol Hill. There aren't even many socialists warming statehouse backbench seats this winter—at press time only six additional DSA candidates had been declared victorious, alongside a handful of hyperlocal wins, such as for neighborhood commissions and boards of education.\n\nVoters are hardly going socialist either. DSA membership has grown from 7,000 to 50,000 since President Donald Trump was elected. But despite the prevalence of the red rose emojis that so-called New Socialists use to signal their allegiances on Twitter, and despite the ubiquity of Ocasio-Cortez's red lipstick on cable news, those numbers are quite small. For perspective, the Libertarian Party has more than half a million registered voters.\n\nSocialists have not seized control of the country, but they did manage to grab a nice juicy handful of the debate. What was once the province of white-haired dead-enders has now become the primary source of fresh new ideas in American politics.\n\nAll of the major Democratic contenders for 2020 have floated at least one signature Sorta Socialist Policy Plank already. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) has a plan to aggressively regulate all corporations at the board level, plus a big subsidy for homebuyers in previously redlined neighborhoods called the American Housing and Mobility Act. Sen. Kamala Harris (D–Calif.) is offering a $500 monthly refundable tax credit to poor families with her Livable Incomes for Families Today (LIFT) Act, which is essentially the Earned Income Tax Credit on meth. She is also part of a Californian crossover initiative called Housing for All, which would involve aggressive subsidies for renters. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D–N.Y.) wants to turn the U.S. Post Office into a bank, while Sen. Cory Booker (D–N.J.) is offering \"baby bonds\" that would be funded by the government annually and mature when the carrier turns 18.\n\nNone of these ideas is new—Hillary Clinton pushed a version of the baby bonds idea back in 2008—but they are newly appealing, thanks in large part to the surprising 2016 primary successes of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.), who has been singing his old refrain of debt-free college and Medicare for All for decades.\n\nAstute readers might note that none of these proposals is actually socialism as it has historically been understood—or as it is currently being practiced in Venezuela, for that matter. The workers do not own the means of production. The economy is not (very) centrally planned. These are not transitional moves toward communism.\n\nAnd yet you may have seen the headlines last August—right around the time of Ocasio-Cortez's primary victory in New York's 14th Congressional District—claiming that Democrats now prefer socialism to capitalism for the first time, according to a Gallup poll. While this is technically true, it's worth noting that this is the result of a dramatic decline in the popularity of capitalism, not a surge in support for socialism. The latter remains essentially unchanged overall. Even among young people, there is no discernible upward trend. (There is an even more marked drop in support for capitalism among the young, however, including a 12-point fall in the last two years.)\n\nGallup does not define either term in its question. The \"Kids These Days Say They Like Socialism, but They Don't Even Know What That Word Really Means\" article has become a media staple. Full disclosure: Reason has even run one or two essays along those lines. But what we talk about when we talk about socialism isn't actually nationalizing the means of production or centrally planning the economy. Sure, for a few diehards, it means replacing identity politics with class consciousness. But for most people, cheering socialism is merely a means for expressing discontent with the current capitalist system and a desire for ambitious public works and entitlement programs.\n\nIt's totally fair to point out that Scandinavian-style redistribution of gains from a market economy is not, in fact, socialism. But that point is nonresponsive to what the country will really be talking about as we debate \"socialism\" for the next couple of years. Instead, we are going to be talking about larger welfare programs, higher taxes, and more regulation. We are going to be exploring more deeply the already established 20th century political technique of campaigning on massive new entitlement programs.\n\nBut most of all, what many people mean when they say they like socialism is not so different from what many mean when they say they like libertarianism—or what they meant when they said they liked Donald Trump. They are fed up with the status quo. They see no appeal in the mushy center. They are, basically, sick of the system as it is and looking for ways to shake things up.\n\nAnd that matters even if Republicans hold the White House for the next two or even six years. Because Trump is not an ideologue, he will be more susceptible than his GOP predecessors to this change in the air. If his opponents' big, debt-funded policy proposals prove popular with the public, there's nothing left to stop the president from mirroring them with giveaways of his own. The few remaining limited-government GOPers in Congress will have their hands full, and with Democrats holding the House, compromise proposals where everyone gets to spend massive amounts of money will look even more attractive to an administration desperate for a major policy success heading into re-election season.\n\nTrump may simply decide that every week is now infrastructure week—he has been champing at the bit to put Americans to work digging ditches and paving roads since day one. But there are more ambitious proposals in the Republican pipeline as well.\n\nDespite the DSA's election-night claim on Twitter that \"Everything's Coming Up Roses,\" the democratic socialists were far from triumphant in 2018. And it's wildly unlikely that a socialist—or anyone even remotely resembling one—will capture the White House in 2020. The United States is not on its way to becoming Venezuela or anything like it, and to suggest otherwise is disingenuous. But for the next couple of years, at least, the socialists may have seized the means of policy production.",

         "I can not wait to learn more about the identity and motives of the secret whistleblower who figures so prominently in stories of Trump ’ s phone call with the newly elected Ukrainian president . The narrative that began a month ago , as an insider ’ s accusation of Trump ’ s threat to cut off U.S. military aid unless investigations were launched into his expected opponent Joe Biden , has evolved considerably .\nIt now appears — in spite of initial denials — that the whistleblower consulted with House Intelligence Committee ( HIC ) staff before filing his complaint — and was advised immediately to obtain counsel . Somehow , the chosen counsel was part of a whistleblower search organization , whose staff had previously worked with HIC chairman Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) . While the whistleblower ’ s complaint was based entirely on secondhand hearsay — which was explicitly precluded under existing reporting rules — those rules were changed after the complaint ’ s receipt so as to do away with the requirement of firsthand knowledge .\nWhat began as an admission that the whistleblower worked for the CIA and was a registered Democrat was accompanied by the absolute assurance that he was not an active partisan and had not worked in any current presidential campaign . That assurance now seems to be evolving into a situation in which the whistleblower had been assigned to the National Security Council , where he worked with former Vice President Biden — and may even have traveled with him on one or more trips to Ukraine .\nWords are being chosen quite carefully , and the truth seems more and more elusive , as Republican HIC members continue to be kept in the dark . One is reminded of Lewis Carroll ’ s Alice in Wonderland , in which Alice exclaims , “ Curiouser and curiouser ! ”\nWhile the mainstream media continues to provide breathless coverage as events unfold , they evidence a strong disinclination to ferret out more information regarding the whistleblower ’ s actual identity or motives in coming forward — almost relishing the idea that HIC hearings can feature his testimony ( whether he is actually present or not ) without his identity ever becoming known .\nThe obvious parallel is to “ Deep Throat , ” Woodward and Bernstein ’ s alleged secret source for many of their Watergate revelations , whose identity remained not only secret but also an integral part of Georgetown cocktail conversation for the next 30 years .\nFor those not living through the halcyon days of Watergate , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein became famous for their series of revelations regarding the status of prosecutors ’ ongoing Watergate investigations , but it was not until their 1974 book , All the President ’ s Men , that they credited a secret source they claimed to have referred to as “ Deep Throat , ” after a popular pornographic movie character . The more recent backstory is that their publisher at Simon & Schuster had encouraged them to add more drama to their proposed book , which is how the term first came into being . In short , Deep Throat was not a term used in print or even newsroom discussions before it first appeared in their book — as their calculatedly mysterious source .\nRegardless , speculation about just who Deep Throat might be was a dominant feature of Washington gossip for the ensuing decades . Possible candidates were inevitably confined to those who had served on President Nixon ’ s White House staff , including his Chief of Staff Alexander Haig , one of his many lawyers ( John Dean , Fred Fielding , Len Garment , or Fred Buzhardt ) , one of his speechwriters ( Bill Safire , David Gergen , or Ben Stein ) , or one of other young White House aides ( including Diane Sawyer , Jonathan Rose , or Jeff Donfeld ) . Even Henry Kissinger ’ s name occasionally surfaced in the unending speculation .\nThe common theme was that Deep Throat had become so disgusted with Nixon ’ s conduct that the need to reveal the wrongdoing far outweighed any idea of loyalty to the president . This was in spite of the fact that my boss and Nixon ’ s lead Watergate defense counsel thought at the time that the leaks were coming from Mark Felt at the FBI . This belief was accompanied by the recognition that we weren ’ t in a position to do much about it , since pressuring Felt might result in even more leaks . In fact , there is a humorous conversation on the White House tapes in which Haig suggests to Nixon that Felt is the one doing the leaking — and characterizes him as “ the white rat. ” Haig goes on to explain that ’ s what Felt is called behind his back at the Bureau : He has a long face and a rather sallow complexion . “ Well , Mr. President , he looks like a rat , ” is how Haig finally sums it up .\nFor decades afterwards , when I would mention that I had worked on Nixon ’ s White House staff , people would inevitably ask if I knew who Deep Throat was . When I answered in the affirmative , they would get all excited — until I said it was Mark Felt , the white rat . Then , since this obviously was not some famous name from Nixon ’ s own White House , their interest would wane and the conversation would move on .\nWhen Felt ’ s daughter claimed he was Deep Throat in 2005 and Woodward and Bernstein rushed out a book , The Secret Man : The Story of Watergate ’ s Deep Throat , supposedly confirming it , everyone accepted it at face value . For his part , Felt was way too senile to provide any real confirmation . More significantly , it turned out that Felt had no animosity toward President Nixon ; his leaks were designed to show that Acting FBI Director Patrick Gray couldn ’ t control the FBI and should be replaced by then–Deputy Director Felt .\nWhy , then , had all of the media been so certain for the prior three decades that Deep Throat simply had to be a disillusioned Nixon White House staffer ? Following Felt ’ s 2005 outing , I went back and re-read All the President ’ s Men and then compared the book to the subsequent movie version — only to discover tantalizing differences in Deep Throat ’ s treatment .\nIn their book , there is no implication whatsoever that Deep Throat is a White House employee . The authors were very careful not to give any hint at all as to his place of employment . The movie version , however , differs considerably — with implied White House employment occurring in three separate scenes : First , relatively early on , Woodward ( played by Robert Redford ) and Bernstein ( played by Dustin Hoffman ) are shown on the Library of Congress steps , lamenting that they are out of leads . Redford offers up the idea that he has a contact at the Nixon White House — and their paucity of leads quickly evaporates . Second , at one point , Redford calls Deep Throat ( played by Hal Holbrook ) at work . In the movie scene , Redford is shown in a public phone booth ( remember those ? ) located on the sidewalk across the street from the Old Executive Office Building — an integral part of the White House compound — which he stares at while speaking to Holbrook , who instructs him never again to call him at work . Third , when Holbrook departs from his office on his way to deliver secret papers in a nighttime rendezvous , he is shown as driving out of the White House ’ s Northwest Gate .\nThe result was the unspoken assurance of Deep Throat being a White House staffer . The movie audience , after all , saw this with their own eyes !\nSeveral other Deep Throat observations : By far the best description of Deep Throat and his activities is Max Holland ’ s Leak : Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat ( 2012 ) , supplemented by Holland ’ s extensive critical review of the 2017 film Mark Felt . Separately , in a stressful FBI interview of Mark Felt , following his FBI retirement and shortly after publication of Woodward and Bernstein ’ s book , Felt is quoted by his FBI interrogators as having specifically denied that he was “ that fellow they call Deep Throat . ”\nIn spite of the Woodward and Bernstein books , I happened to believe their Deep Throat is a composite figure , rather than their exclusive source , a view apparently shared by their boss , Ben Bradlee . In an unpublished interview cited by Jeff Himmelman in Yours in Truth : A Personal Portrait of Ben Bradlee , Legendary Editor of The Washington Post ( 2012 ) , Bradlee expressed his own doubts as to the authenticity of the Deep Throat story :\nYou know I have a little problem with Deep Throat.… Did that potted [ plant ] incident ever happen ? … and meeting in some garage . One meeting in the garage ? Fifty meetings in the garage ? I don ’ t know how many meetings in the garage.… There ’ s a residual fear in my soul that that isn ’ t quite straight .\nIt also is interesting to note that lead Watergate prosecutor Earl Silbert has stated that nothing in the Woodward and Bernstein articles was helpful to his team of prosecutors since their stories were only reporting what the government already knew and had under investigation . Thus , while news to the general public , it was not revealing to those actually working on the case .\nOne wonders just how a reputation for relentlessly innovative and creative investigative reporting can be based on receiving a series of leaks from a disgruntled FBI official . Perhaps that ’ s why it was so important to keep Deep Throat ’ s identity secret long after the Watergate scandal had run its course .\nFinally , and most significantly , it is now clear that the American public was knowingly misled for three decades regarding Deep Throat ’ s identity and motive — all seemingly for the purpose of further undermining President Nixon and his White House staff .\nJust when , one might ask in light of all this , can we expect to learn the full truth about Trump ’ s whistleblower ?\nGeoff Shepard came to Washington , D.C. , as a White House Fellow right after graduation from Harvard Law School and spent five years on Nixon ’ s White House staff , including being deputy counsel on his Watergate defense team .

Separately, in a stressful FBI interview of Mark Felt, following his FBI retirement and shortly after publication of Woodward and Bernstein’s book, Felt is quoted by his FBI interrogators as having specifically denied that he was “that fellow they call Deep Throat.”\n\nIn spite of the Woodward and Bernstein books, I happened to believe their Deep Throat is a composite figure, rather than their exclusive source, a view apparently shared by their boss, Ben Bradlee. In an unpublished interview cited by Jeff Himmelman in Yours in Truth: A Personal Portrait of Ben Bradlee, Legendary Editor of The Washington Post (2012), Bradlee expressed his own doubts as to the authenticity of the Deep Throat story:\n\nYou know I have a little problem with Deep Throat.… Did that potted [plant] incident ever happen?… and meeting in some garage. One meeting in the garage? Fifty meetings in the garage? I don’t know how many meetings in the garage.… There’s a residual fear in my soul that that isn’t quite straight.\n\nIt also is interesting to note that lead Watergate prosecutor Earl Silbert has stated that nothing in the Woodward and Bernstein articles was helpful to his team of prosecutors since their stories were only reporting what the government already knew and had under investigation. Thus, while news to the general public, it was not revealing to those actually working on the case.\n\nOne wonders just how a reputation for relentlessly innovative and creative investigative reporting can be based on receiving a series of leaks from a disgruntled FBI official. Perhaps that’s why it was so important to keep Deep Throat’s identity secret long after the Watergate scandal had run its course.\n\nFinally, and most significantly, it is now clear that the American public was knowingly misled for three decades regarding Deep Throat’s identity and motive — all seemingly for the purpose of further undermining President Nixon and his White House staff.\n\nJust when, one might ask in light of all this, can we expect to learn the full truth about Trump’s whistleblower?\n\nGeoff Shepard came to Washington, D.C., as a White House Fellow right after graduation from Harvard Law School and spent five years on Nixon’s White House staff, including being deputy counsel on his Watergate defense team.

Henry Cuellar (D-TX) told CBN News.\n\nThe Texas lawmaker serves on the bipartisan conference committee that's currently negotiating the compromise bill for border security.\n\n\"We have to find a balance between our neighbor to the south and at the same time...have security, and I feel very confident that if we put the technology, the personnel, and, I'll say this as a Democrat find ways to do enhanced physical barriers, we can get there,\" Cuellar said.\n\nHe's one of just a handful of Democrats pleased to hear the president re-affirm his commitment to protecting the unborn.\n\n\"I'm one of four, five, six Democrats - I'm pro-life. I'll do whatever I can to make sure we protect life, but I do know the makeup of House and you have to get to 60 over there (in the Senate) – and so to get to where the president wants to get to might be difficult at this time,\" he acknowledged.\n\nMany Republicans supported the president's strong pro-life statements as well.\n\n\"He talked about the unborn; I was very appreciative of that moment, too,\" Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) told CBN News. \"To recognize that life is precious and that it should be protected, unlike what's going on in New York and Virginia. So those were all very inspiring moments.\"\n\nHowever, the high from this year's address will be short-lived for Republicans if lawmakers fail to reach a compromise by the end of next week to prevent another government shutdown.",

In fact, when I was growing up, bigotry and racism were addressed in my family by making it clear that these were toxic and sinister beliefs that should always be called out and shunned. I can’t tell you about the man who was on the phone with Richard Nixon that day in 1971. He’s not a man I knew.\"\n\nHowever, this is not the first time the former Republican president has been criticized for racist remarks.\n\nDuring his 1966 campaign for governor in California Reagan told a crowd of supporters that, “If an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes or others in selling or renting his house, it is his right to do so,” according to Politico.\n\nHe also, famously, began the “welfare queen” stereotype against black women, helping create a narrative that black women abuse taxpayer dollars to support lazy and lavish lifestyles.\n\nHistorians have also cited “racist policies” he implemented during his presidency to disproportionately harm people of color which laid the groundwork for his “War on Drugs.”\n\nThis previously unheard audio recording has surfaced during President Donald Trump’s relentless Twitter attacks on four minority progressive congresswomen and Baltimore Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pauses during an address at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, Aug. 1, 2019. Bryan Woolston/Reuters\n\nTrump has often referenced Reagan during his presidency and even shares a slogan Reagan used during his 1980 campaign, ‘Make America Great Again.’\n\nTrump has repeatedly defended his statements including tweeting that he doesn’t have “a racist bone in his body.”\n\nA July Quinnipiac poll found that 51% of Americans view Trump as a racist.",

         "As a first step , I believe it necessary for the members and leadership of the Democratic National Committee to step down and be replaced by people who are determined to create a party that represents America – including all those who feel powerless and disenfranchised , and who have been left out of our politics and left behind in our economy .\nThe Democratic Party as it is now constituted has become a giant fundraising machine , too often reflecting the goals and values of the moneyed interests . This must change . The election of 2016 has repudiated it . We need a people ’ s party – a party capable of organizing and mobilizing Americans in opposition to Donald Trump ’ s Republican party , which is about to take over all three branches of the U.S. government . We need a New Democratic Party that will fight against intolerance and widening inequality .\nWhat happened in America Tuesday should not be seen as a victory for hatefulness over decency . It is more accurately understood as a repudiation of the American power structure .\nAt the core of that structure are the political leaders of both parties , their political operatives , and fundraisers ; the major media , centered in New York and Washington DC ; the country ’ s biggest corporations , their top executives , and Washington lobbyists and trade associations ; the biggest Wall Street banks , their top officers , traders , hedge-fund and private-equity managers , and their lackeys in Washington ; and the wealthy individuals who invest directly in politics .\nAt the start of the 2016 election cycle , this power structure proclaimed Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush shoo-ins for the nominations of the Democratic and Republican parties . After all , both of these individuals had deep bases of funders , well-established networks of political insiders , experienced political advisers and all the political name recognition any candidate could possibly want .\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the White House . The presidency was won by Donald Trump , who made his fortune marketing office towers and casinos , and , more recently , starring in a popular reality-television program , and who has never held elective office or had anything to do with the Republican party . Hillary Clinton narrowly won the popular vote , but not enough of the states and their electors secure a victory .\nHillary Clinton ’ s defeat is all the more remarkable in that her campaign vastly outspent the Trump campaign on television and radio advertisements , and get-out-the-vote efforts . Moreover , her campaign had the support in the general election not of only the kingpins of the Democratic party but also many leading Republicans , including most of the politically active denizens of Wall Street and the top executives of America ’ s largest corporations , and even former Republican president George HW Bush . Her campaign team was run by seasoned professionals who knew the ropes . She had the visible and forceful backing of Barack Obama , whose popularity has soared in recent months , and his popular wife . And , of course , she had her husband .\nTrump , by contrast , was shunned by the power structure . Mitt Romney , the Republican presidential candidate in 2012 , actively worked against Trump ’ s nomination . Many senior Republicans refused to endorse him , or even give him their support . The Republican National Committee did not raise money for Trump to the extent it had for other Republican candidates for president .\nThere had been hints of the political earthquake to come . Trump had won the Republican primaries , after all . More tellingly , Clinton had been challenged in the Democratic primaries by the unlikeliest of candidates – a 74-year-old Jewish senator from Vermont who described himself as a democratic socialist and who was not even a Democrat .

Workers without college degrees – the old working class – have fallen furthest . Most economic gains , meanwhile , have gone to top . These gains have translated into political power to elicit bank bailouts , corporate subsidies , special tax loopholes , favorable trade deals and increasing market power without interference by anti-monopoly enforcement – all of which have further reduced wages and pulled up profits .\nWealth , power and crony capitalism fit together .

         "After 10 years of silence - a decade of dodging questions about the infamous stain on her blue dress and the jokes about the president's cigar - Bill Clinton's mistress, Monica Lewinsky, spoke out in Vanity Fair.\n\nRemembering the Monica Lewinsky Scandal\n\nHere's what she had to say:\n\n1. She May Not Stay Quiet if Hillary Runs\n\nLewinsky says she \"remained virtually reclusive\" during Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign despite repeated interview requests. Now that Hillary is reportedly mulling a 2016 bid, Lewinsky finds herself \"gun-shy yet again, fearful of 'becoming an issue' should she decide to ramp up her campaign.\" But she's not sure she'll stay quiet this time.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who says she's still recognized everywhere she goes, has had enough of \"tiptoeing around my past - and other people's futures.\"\n\nSo though she acknowledges speaking out may have severe ramifications, \"I've decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past … It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress.\"\n\n2. What She Finds 'Troubling' About Hillary\n\nLewinsky seems to resent Hillary Clinton's reaction - and rejects the then-first lady's characterization of her as a \" narcissistic loony toon.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Clinton, I read, had supposedly confided to [Diane] Blair that, in part, she blamed herself for her husband's affair (by being emotionally neglectful) and seemed to forgive him … I find her impulse to blame the Woman - not only me, but herself - troubling,\" Lewinsky argues.\n\nHer refusal to cooperate with interrogators may have been \"courageous or foolish,\" she admits. \"But narcissistic and loony?\" No way.\n\n3. The Relationship Was Consensual\n\nLewinsky maintains that her relationship with Clinton was voluntary.\n\n\"Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship,\" Lewinsky writes. \"Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position.\"\n\nNevertheless, she says, she \"regrets\" the relationship. \"Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened.,\" she writes.\n\n4. The Clintons Didn't Pay Her Off\n\nThe Clintons didn't bribe her to stay quiet, Lewinsky insists.\n\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" she writes. She turned down $10 million-plus \"offers\" (presumably interview requests) \"because they didn't feel like the right thing to do.\"\n\nHowever, money has been an issue since the incident. Lewinsky pursued a career in marketing, but \"because of what potential employers so tactfully referred to as my 'history, I was never 'quite right' for the position.\"\n\nShe has \"managed to get by (barely, at times) with my own projects… or loans from friends,\" she says.\n\n5. She Contemplated Suicide\n\nThough she never actually attempted suicide, Lewinsky says she was tempted end her own life as \"the shame, the scorn, and the fear\" washed over her.\n\nShe says the tragic suicide of 18-year-old Tyler Clementi, the gay Rutgers student who was filmed kissing another man, brought back those terrible memories and inspired her to come forward.\n\n\"Perhaps by sharing my story … I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation,\" Lewinksi says.",

         "The United Kingdom Supreme Court has ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was acting unlawfully when he suspended Parliament in August for five weeks , a move which anti-Brexit campaigners claimed was intended to thwart their attempts to prevent Britain leaving the European Union .\nIn a shock ruling which strongly went against the government on every count , the Supreme Court in London unanimously found Tuesday morning that Boris Johnson ’ s decision to suspend Parliament was not only unlawful but was null and void , meaning it legally did not take place . Parliament is now free to sit again as soon as desired by the speakers of both houses , the court explained .\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now reacted , speaking to the BBC on a balcony of the United Nations building in New York , insisting that despite the court ruling against him this morning Brexit would still be going ahead at the end of October as planned .\nIn remarks that have already angered remainers , the Prime Minister said he regretted the decision of the court but pointed out the coalition of anti-Brexit campaigners who have worked tirelessly to prevent Britain ’ s withdrawal from going ahead .\nAs I say , I strongly disagree with this decision of the supreme court , I have the utmost respect for our judiciary , I don ’ think this was the right decision I think that the prerogative of prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge . It is perfectly usual to have Queen ’ s speech , that ’ s what we want to do . More importantly , let ’ s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit . There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU . We have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued , doesn ’ t want to have an election , and I think it is time we took things forward . …as the law currently stands , the UK leaves the EU on October the 31st come what may , but the interesting , exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal and that ’ s what we are working on . And I ’ ll be honest with you… it is not made much easier by this kind of stuff in Parliament and the courts . Obviously getting a deal is not made much easier against this background but we ’ ve got to get on and do it . …As the law stands we leave on October the 31st and I am very hopeful that we will get a deal , and I think what the people of the country want is to see Parliamentarians coming together , working in the national interest to get this thing done , and that is what we are going to do .\nA government spokesman has said the Prime Minister will not resign , and he will return to the United Kingdom tonight after his speech to the United Nations .\nUpdate 1305 : Farage calls Boris proroguing parliament “ worst political decision ever ”\nBrexit leader Nigel Farage has no sympathy for Boris Johnson ’ s unforced error and has said his chief advisor Dominic Cummings — who has frequently crossed swords with Farage & co in the past — should step down over the affair which he is widely thought to have engineered .\nSpeaking to Breitbart London before the ruling was made , Mr Farage said : “ We have a Parliament that twice has stopped us from having a General Election and instead we have a Supreme Court making a decision as to whether Boris Johnson remains prime minister ; virtually , that ’ s how important the ruling is .\n“ I don ’ t like it one little bit and I think our whole constitution has been thrown completely up into the air by Speaker Bercow and others . ”\nRead that and the responses of other political figures at Breitbart London\nThe Supreme Court was the creation of the Blair years of government , a time of enormous constitutional and political change in the United Kingdom .

         "Three more prominent US Democrats have called for the impeachment of President Trump , after Special Counsel Robert Mueller made his first public remarks .\nSpeaking on Wednesday , Mr Mueller said his investigation had not exonerated Mr Trump of obstruction of justice , contradicting the president 's claims .\nMr Mueller was tasked with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election .\nHe said charging a sitting president with a crime was not an option .\nThe issue of impeachment has divided the Democratic Party , pitting a growing number of lawmakers against Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the house and the most senior Democrat . Ms Pelosi has so far resisted the idea , arguing that it would be counter-productive .\nBut Mr Mueller 's remarks prompted three leading Democratic presidential hopefuls to join the chorus calling for impeachment , bringing the total to 10 of 23 declared candidates .\nAt the White House on Thursday morning , Mr Trump said Mr Mueller was `` a totally conflicted person '' and a `` true Never Trumper '' , referring to his Republican critics in the 2016 White House race .\nHe also said impeachment was a `` dirty , filthy disgusting word '' and the inquiry was `` a giant presidential harassment '' .\nIn response to Mr Mueller 's remarks , Democratic candidates Cory Booker , Kirsten Gillibrand and Pete Buttigieg publicly advocated for the first time for impeachment .\n`` Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately , '' said Mr Booker , a senator from New Jersey .\nNew York Senator Ms Gillibrand said it was `` time for Republicans and Democrats to begin impeachment hearings and follow the facts wherever they may lead '' .\nIndiana mayor Pete Buttigieg tweeted : `` This is as close to an impeachment referral as it gets . ''\nOther senators reiterated earlier calls for impeachment . `` It is up to Congress to hold this president accountable . We need to start impeachment proceedings , '' said California senator Kamala Harris .\nVermont senator Bernie Sanders stopped short of endorsing proceedings , but said in an Instagram post : `` If the House Judiciary Committee deems it necessary , I will support their decision to open an impeachment inquiry . ''\nResponding to Mr Mueller 's statement , House Speaker Ms Pelosi said : `` The Congress holds sacred its constitutional responsibility to investigate and hold the President accountable for his abuse of power . ''\nMr Trump said on Twitter there was `` insufficient evidence '' against him , `` and therefore , in our Country , a person is innocent '' .\nRepresentative Doug Collins , the most senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , said that `` reinvestigating the special counsel 's findings '' would `` only further divide our country '' .\nThe first Republican congressman to call for Mr Trump 's impeachment , Representative Justin Amash , said : `` The ball is in our court , Congress . ''\nMeanwhile , White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said : `` After two years , the Special Counsel is moving on with his life , and everyone else should do the same . ''\nMr Mueller largely reaffirmed what was in his report , which was released last month to the public , with substantial redactions .\nHe detailed 10 instances where Mr Trump had possibly attempted to impede the investigation , but said that charging the president with a crime was not an option for the special counsel .\n`` The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing , '' he said , in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process .\nHe said that if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump `` clearly did not commit a crime , we would have said so '' .\nMr Mueller said he did not believe it was `` appropriate to speak further '' about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team 's report .\nWith Democratic lawmakers seeking to have him testify in Congress , Mr Mueller said : `` The report is my testimony . ''\nHe also announced the formal closure of the special counsel office and his resignation from the justice department to return to private life .\nRobert Mueller did n't break much new ground in his eight-minute statement announcing the official end of the special counsel investigation . Instead , he highlighted in bold what he views as the key points of nearly two years of work .\nMr Mueller started and ended by emphasising that America during the 2016 election was under attack by malign foreign actors . He said those allegations deserve the attention of every American .\nIn the portion of his investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign , Mr Mueller said there was `` insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy '' - hardly the complete vindication the president asserts .\nWhen it comes to obstruction of justice , he chipped away further at the president 's defences .

         "Top Republicans Brad Raffensperger and David Emadi are issuing subpoenas to opponents without showing evidence of wrongdoing\nTop Georgia Republicans continue to use the power of the state to investigate political rivals , executing a strategy that voting rights activists say is designed to intimidate voting rights organizations and activists serving minority communities .\nBrad Raffensperger , the secretary of state , and David Emadi , executive secretary of the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission , are investigating and issuing subpoenas to political opponents , without publicly showing evidence there was wrongdoing by those parties .\n'Rigging the game ' : Stacey Abrams kicks off campaign to fight voter suppression Read more\nGeorgia ’ s governor , Brian Kemp , pioneered the tactic as secretary of state , where he used his authority to investigate political opponents , liberal political groups and get out the vote ( GOTV ) organizers working in racial minority communities .\nTo date , none of the investigations , subpoenas , arrests or prosecutions against political opponents and minority GOTV organizers have led to convictions , meaning that Kemp ’ s – and now Raffensperger and Emadi ’ s – political rivals remain innocent of charges brought against them .\nBut voting rights activists say there is a trend in Georgia of Republicans using the power of an elected office to investigate political opponents as a voter intimidation tactic .\nVoter intimidation has changed its nature since the billy club and water hose violence of the 1960s , according to Carol Anderson , a historian studying public policy and race at Emory University .\nBecause voter intimidation is no longer exercised through violence , and is instead exercised through subpoenas and investigations , Anderson argues the practice does not register as strongly with the public . Voter intimidation by the state , however , remains closely tied to race . In today ’ s politics , race and party are almost indistinguishable , Anderson said , blurring the lines between what is politically or racially motivated .\n“ Because we don ’ t see the night stick , because we don ’ t see the teargas , it doesn ’ t register for us as intimidation . But it is just as powerful , just as malignant , just as malevolent … the whole point is that blacks get hurt worse than whites , ” said Anderson .\nThe governor ’ s and secretary of state ’ s offices have not responded to requests for comment .\nIn 2019 , after Kemp won the gubernatorial election , the state ’ s campaign finance commission appointed Emadi , a political ally who contributed $ 600 to Kemp ’ s campaign . Emadi quickly opened an investigation into Stacey Abrams ’ campaign , alleging Kemp ’ s rival exceeded maximum contribution limits .\nEmadi issued subpoenas seeking banking and financial records . The subpoenas also seek extensive communications between the campaign and a network of political groups that are run by or are focused on people of color , which has sparked accusations of racial and political motivations behind the investigation .\n███ obtained communications between attorneys for the campaign and Emadi which show that the commission did not provide any evidence of their allegations , or the “ basis for the finding of probable cause ” , as required in the commission rules .\nIn 2019 , Raffensperger opened an investigation into an alleged 4,700 missing absentee ballot requests in DeKalb county , coming from voters the Abrams campaign targeted , from November ’ s midterm elections . Using absentee ballots as a way to increase voter turnout among unlikely or first-time voters was a primary strategy of the Abrams campaign , which led to Abrams outperforming Kemp in mail-in ballots by 53,709 votes .\nOne of the first calls from investigators was to the mail-processing vendor the Abrams campaign used , according to Lauren Groh-Wargo , Abrams ’ former campaign manager . She now runs Fair Fight , an organization started by Abrams to challenge current voting laws and procedures in Georgia .\nThe investigation remains open , with no conclusion as to what happened to the ballot applications .\nOpening investigations against Democratic candidates , the state Democratic party or liberal political groups that report issues to the secretary of state ’ s office , only to have the mechanism of the state turned against them , has become a political trend in Georgia .\nThese types of investigations could have a chilling effect on people or groups interested in organizing in their communities .\n“ If you ’ re going to open up a shop organizing Latinos or Asian Americans or whatever the group may be , you need to be prepared in Georgia for the power of the state to come down on you and your folks , ” Groh-Wargo said . “ Your folks need to be ready that they could be literally criminalized for this type of activity , and that you need to have lawyers on the ready . ”\nThe power of opening investigations and keeping them open for years has a big impact , Groh-Wargo said .\nIt shuts the work of organizers down – which has not yet happened due to any of the investigations – and shuts the funding of the organization down . It is more difficult , Groh-Wargo said , to raise money when your organization is being investigated for a crime .\n“ To show that there is actually no wrongdoing is an incredible burden for an organization to have to manage a board through that , or for the board to have to explain it to its funders , ” Groh-Wargo said .\nRaffensperger ’ s office is also exercising the power of the subpoena . Secretary of state lawyers used a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Georgia ’ s election system to issue subpoenas for extensive financial and communication records from a number of left-leaning civil rights groups and churches – when none of those organizations are party to the case .\nResponding to the subpoenas will cost each organization time and thousands of dollars .\nThe most extreme example of an investigation on false pretenses came on 4 November 2018 , two days before the midterm election . The secretary of state ’ s office knowingly falsely accused the Democratic party of Georgia of attempting to hack the election . The initial round of media coverage reflected the accusation , before the facts were available that the accusation was fabricated .\n“ That was weaponizing and using the office of the secretary of state to accuse the political party , ” said Sara Ghazal , the voter protection director for the Democratic party of Georgia .\n███ interviewed voter registration organizers in Asian American and black communities , and leaders from Fair Fight and the Democratic party of Georgia . Each independently asserted the investigations were politically motivated .\n“ These weaponized investigations are used to change the entire political narrative , not only around political campaigns and individuals , but around issues , ” Ghazal said . “ Voter protection , voter integrity , election integrity , should never be a political issue . And yet , you ’ ve got debates now that are wholly politicized . ”\nThat investigation into the Democratic party of Georgia has not concluded . No officials have been questioned or related subpoenas issued . Like each of the others , it has yet to produce any prosecutions , additional evidence , or convictions .\nGhazal runs the largest voter protection project in the country and has records of tens of thousands of voter complaints over the last couple years .\nGiven the recent history of investigations being turned against political opponents , Ghazal is purposely avoiding the secretary of state ’ s office for fear of “ inadvertently giving them something else that can be weaponized against an individual voter or against the party ” .",

Emadi quickly opened an investigation into Stacey Abrams’ campaign, alleging Kemp’s rival exceeded maximum contribution limits.\n\nEmadi issued subpoenas seeking banking and financial records. The subpoenas also seek extensive communications between the campaign and a network of political groups that are run by or are focused on people of color, which has sparked accusations of racial and political motivations behind the investigation.\n\nEmadi has denied any racial or political motivations.\n\nThe Guardian obtained communications between attorneys for the campaign and Emadi which show that the commission did not provide any evidence of their allegations, or the “basis for the finding of probable cause”, as required in the commission rules.\n\nEmadi said he could not comment on open investigations.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp at a debate in Atlanta, Georgia, on 23 October 2018. Photograph: POOL New/Reuters\n\nIn 2019, Raffensperger opened an investigation into an alleged 4,700 missing absentee ballot requests in DeKalb county, coming from voters the Abrams campaign targeted, from November’s midterm elections. Using absentee ballots as a way to increase voter turnout among unlikely or first-time voters was a primary strategy of the Abrams campaign, which led to Abrams outperforming Kemp in mail-in ballots by 53,709 votes.\n\nOne of the first calls from investigators was to the mail-processing vendor the Abrams campaign used, according to Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams’ former campaign manager. She now runs Fair Fight, an organization started by Abrams to challenge current voting laws and procedures in Georgia.\n\nThe investigation remains open, with no conclusion as to what happened to the ballot applications.\n\nOpening investigations against Democratic candidates, the state Democratic party or liberal political groups that report issues to the secretary of state’s office, only to have the mechanism of the state turned against them, has become a political trend in Georgia.\n\nThese types of investigations could have a chilling effect on people or groups interested in organizing in their communities.\n\n“If you’re going to open up a shop organizing Latinos or Asian Americans or whatever the group may be, you need to be prepared in Georgia for the power of the state to come down on you and your folks,” Groh-Wargo said. “Your folks need to be ready that they could be literally criminalized for this type of activity, and that you need to have lawyers on the ready.”\n\nThe power of opening investigations and keeping them open for years has a big impact, Groh-Wargo said.\n\nIt shuts the work of organizers down – which has not yet happened due to any of the investigations – and shuts the funding of the organization down. It is more difficult, Groh-Wargo said, to raise money when your organization is being investigated for a crime.\n\n“To show that there is actually no wrongdoing is an incredible burden for an organization to have to manage a board through that, or for the board to have to explain it to its funders,” Groh-Wargo said.\n\nRaffensperger’s office is also exercising the power of the subpoena. Secretary of state lawyers used a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Georgia’s election system to issue subpoenas for extensive financial and communication records from a number of left-leaning civil rights groups and churches – when none of those organizations are party to the case.\n\nResponding to the subpoenas will cost each organization time and thousands of dollars.\n\nThe most extreme example of an investigation on false pretenses came on 4 November 2018, two days before the midterm election. The secretary of state’s office knowingly falsely accused the Democratic party of Georgia of attempting to hack the election. The initial round of media coverage reflected the accusation, before the facts were available that the accusation was fabricated.\n\n“That was weaponizing and using the office of the secretary of state to accuse the political party,” said Sara Ghazal, the voter protection director for the Democratic party of Georgia.\n\nThe Guardian interviewed voter registration organizers in Asian American and black communities, and leaders from Fair Fight and the Democratic party of Georgia. Each independently asserted the investigations were politically motivated.\n\n“These weaponized investigations are used to change the entire political narrative, not only around political campaigns and individuals, but around issues,” Ghazal said. “Voter protection, voter integrity, election integrity, should never be a political issue. And yet, you’ve got debates now that are wholly politicized.”\n\nThat investigation into the Democratic party of Georgia has not concluded. No officials have been questioned or related subpoenas issued. Like each of the others, it has yet to produce any prosecutions, additional evidence, or convictions.\n\nGhazal runs the largest voter protection project in the country and has records of tens of thousands of voter complaints over the last couple years.\n\nGiven the recent history of investigations being turned against political opponents, Ghazal is purposely avoiding the secretary of state’s office for fear of “inadvertently giving them something else that can be weaponized against an individual voter or against the party”.",

         "The horrific story of the unarmed Walter Scott 's death at the hands of Officer Michael Slager continues to reverberate . Aside from the incontrovertible evidence on the tape that the accused officer shot him in the back as if he were doing target practice , there has since emerged more tape of the traffic stop itself and audio of the officer speaking with his superiors on the phone raising even more questions about his state of mind at the time of the shooting . But as journalists have gone back and studied the officer 's record and found that he was previously investigated for taser abuse . And on even further investigation it was found that this jurisdiction is known as `` Taser town '' :\nUntil the eight shots heard ’ round the world , cops in North Charleston , South Carolina , were primarily distinguished by their zesty use of Tasers . As computed by a local newspaper in 2006 , cops there used Tasers 201 times in an 18-month period , averaging once every 40 hours in one six-month stretch and disproportionately upon African Americans . The Charleston Post & Courier did the tally after the death of a mentally ill man named Kip Black , who was tasered six times on one occasion and nine times on another . Black died immediately after the second jolting , though the coroner set the cause of death as cocaine-fueled “ excited delirium syndrome . ”\nIt 's important to note that Taser International has spent large sums convincing local coroners that this syndrome ( which primarily seems to kill people in police custody ) makes it the victim 's responsibility if they have the bad luck to die from being shot full of electricity with a taser . It 's not just illegal drugs in the system which can allegedly cause it . Adrenaline can as well . So if a person fails to remain calm in face of an arrest and finds the feeling of 50,000 volts going through their system to be stressful they have no one to blame but themselves if they die .\nThose who have been following the story of Walter Scott understand the significance of the taser . It 's not just that the officer evidently lied about Scott taking his taser , thus somehow justifying his using lethal force , or the fact that he appears to have tried to plant the taser next to the slain man 's body to cover his tracks . The man who filmed the shooting said this :\n“ I remember the police had control of the situation . He had control of Scott , and Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser . You can hear the sound of the Taser ... before I started recording . I believe he just wanted to get away from the Taser . ”\nIt 's not unusual for people to try to escape from a taser if they can . It is , quite literally , a torture device designed to force compliance with terrible pain . The people of Taser Town , particularly African American men , undoubtedly understand exactly what is going to happen if they find themselves in the custody of a police officer . Here 's one example of how it would likely go down , as reported by The Guardian :\nSlager is among three patrolmen named in a lawsuit filed by Julius Wilson , who said he was arrested after being stopped in his car in August last year . Wilson is also suing the city of North Charleston , the city police department and police chief Eddie Driggers . Speaking at a press conference on Monday , Wilson described Slager and his colleagues as “ bad , corrupt cops ” . He said : “ The use of excessive force or punishment to torture suspects is not something that should be tolerated by the North Charleston police department. ” [ ... ]\nWilson , who has a criminal record , said he was stopped on 25 August because his vehicle had a broken tail light . Scott , 50 , was stopped for the same reason on 5 April before fleeing and being shot dead by Slager . Wilson was stopped by an Officer Edwards , he said , who was joined 10 minutes later by Slager and an officer Clemens despite Wilson calmly “ making small talk and laughing ” . After refusing to step out until he was told why he was being arrested , Wilson claimed , he was forcibly pulled out of his vehicle by Slager and the two other officers . The three then “ forcibly restrained Wilson on his stomach on the pavement face down , ” the lawsuit stated . Despite Wilson “ not moving , nor resisting ” and lying with his hands above his head , the lawsuit claimed , Slager broke a silence among the officers by shouting : “ Watch out ! I ’ m going to tase ! ” He then allegedly “ shot his NCPD-issued taser into Wilson ’ s back ” . The lawsuit alleged Wilson “ writhed in pain from the electric shock ” . It said when Slager warned his colleagues he was about to fire his taser , “ Wilson was cooperating fully ” and allowing the two other officers to place his hands behind his back .\nTasers guidelines vary by department and jurisdiction , but generally their use is only considered reasonable when the subject poses a safety threat . Clearly , shooting an unarmed 50-year-old man when he runs from the taser is not one of those cases . The video of the Scott incident shows that Officer Slager is confused on that issue , to say the least . And it 's just as clear , based on that same standard , that nobody could ever claim such force is justified when presented with an unarmed suspect facing down on the ground , with his hands behind his back . Using a taser in that situation is simply a form of unofficial street justice , a little torture at the hands of the authorities to make a point . Tasers are not simply used in place of lethal force , and they 're not always used to force compliance . They are very often used as on-the-spot punishment by police who want to teach citizens a lesson .\nTake the now notorious California incident that happened to be filmed by a local news station , in which a man on horseback led police on a chase through the desert . When he fell from the horse , police swarmed and he very clearly laid down on his stomach and put his hands behind his back . Then the police beat the hell out of him and tasered him repeatedly . This footage has garnered widespread criticism because of the beating , and for good reason . It 's brutal , primitive behavior .\nBut you wo n't find many people expressing outrage about the electric shocks being administered to this man over and over again . Here 's a typical news report of the incident :\nIn video captured by cameras aboard a helicopter for KNBC , deputies gather around the man after he falls from a horse he was riding to flee from them . The video shows deputies using a stun gun on him and then repeatedly kicking and hitting him . KNBC reported that the man -- identified by authorities as Francis Pusok -- appeared to be kicked 17 times , punched 37 times and hit with a baton four times .\nAgain , if you look at the footage , Pusok was on the ground , face down with his hands behind his back before anyone tasered him or physically assaulted him . And yet the tasering is apparently considered a-ok. At the very least , it is n't mentioned as something that shocks the conscience the way the beating does.Perhaps this is because the searing pain of electro-shock does n't leave much in the way of a mark . But hideously painful it is . Yet for some reason , delivering this particular agony to a suspect is not something people reject when there is no danger to police or bystanders , and the suspect is compliant . But police do it routinely , and are rarely sanctioned for it .\nSome of this undoubtedly stems from the fact that popular culture has turned tasering into slapstick comedy . Movies and TV shows and countless Youtube videos portray it as a hilarious joke . `` Do n't tase me bro '' became as national catch phrase . But it 's not funny . Tasers can kill people . And regardless of what level of respect and compliance one thinks police are entitled to get from the public , they are not entitled to torture and punish citizens to teach them a lesson .\nWalter Scott ran from the pain of the taser and he was shot in the back numerous times for doing it . Francis Pusok was compliant and was tasered and beaten repeatedly anyway . It appears that such shootings and beatings , when captured on film anyway , are still considered beyond the pale in America these days . In both cases , officers will have to face some sanction for their behavior . Slager is facing a murder charge . It 's unknown what the California cops will face , but the FBI is investigating , so there may be some federal civil rights charges . It will be very interesting if any of the officers are charged with assault for using the taser . Let 's just say it will be among the vast minority of cases ever brought if they are .",

Trump calls the book “lies”.\n\nManafort plea deal\n\nFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort agrees to cooperate with federal prosecutors, in a deal that will later fall apart when Manafort, prosecutors allege, continues to lie to them.\n\nFord testifies\n\nDr Christine Blasey Ford tells the Senate judiciary committee that Trump’s pick for supreme court justice, Brett Kavanaugh, assaulted her. Asked if she was sure her attacker was Kavanaugh, she replied: “100%.” Kavanaugh denies the allegations, and his confirmation to the supreme court goes ahead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christine Blasey Ford is sworn in before testifying the Senate judiciary committee on Capitol Hill on 27 September. Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nOctober\n\nKhashoggi cover-up\n\nTrump deems as “credible” a Saudi explanation that journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who had disappeared inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, died in a fistfight. Later Trump blames “rogue killers” and denies a US intelligence conclusion that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was directly involved in the killing.\n\nMocks Ford\n\nAt a Mississippi rally, Trump mocks Christine Blasey Ford, delivering a crude imitation of Ford from her testimony, in which she vividly described a violent sexual assault she alleged Brett Kavanaugh committed against her in the early 1980s.\n\nAttacks media after bombings\n\nAt a rally, Trump blames media “hostility” after a wave of pipe bombs were sent to senior Democrats, prominent critics and the broadcaster CNN.\n\nPittsburgh synagogue shooting\n\nAfter 11 worshippers are killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, experts warn that Trump had “dramatically elevated the level of rhetorical tension in ways that do not discourage people from acting out their terrifying views”.\n\n‘Enemy of the people’\n\nDespite the demonstrable dangers associated with his inflammatory rhetoric, Trump resumes calling the media the “enemy of the people” and blames “the Fake News Media” for the “great anger in our Country”.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly. That will do much to put out the flame...\n\nDeploys troops to border\n\nDays before the midterm elections, Trump deploys more than 5,200 troops to the border with Mexico in what a rights organization described as an abuse of the military and what Senator Claire McCaskill later called “made-for-TV bullshit”.\n\nNovember\n\nBlue wave sweeps midterms\n\nDemocrats win at least 39 seats in the House of Representatives, seizing control of the body; flip multiple state legislatures; swipe governorships; and avoid losses in the Senate in an election that saw historic voter turnout. “Tremendous success tonight,” Trump tweeted. “Thank you all!”\n\nHostile press conference\n\nIn a news conference after the election, Trump threatens a “warlike” response if Democrats investigate him and yelled down multiple journalists. The White House suspends CNN’s Jim Acosta’s credentials, but is later forced to reinstate them.\n\nTrades in Sessions for Whitaker\n\nA day after the election, Trump fires the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and installs Matt Whitaker, who had come to Trump’s attention through fawning appearances on cable television, as acting attorney general.\n\nCalls for ‘new election’\n\nTrump challenges multiple election results on Twitter, including in Arizona – “Electoral corruption – Call for a new Election?”; in Florida – “An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected”; and in Georgia – “It is time to move on!”\n\nSubmits answers to Mueller\n\nTrump submits written replies to the special counsel’s office, in a move that is followed in short order by a flood of new moves in the special counsel investigation.\n\nNew Cohen guilty plea\n\nCohen pleads guilty to a new set of charges including lying to Congress about Trump Organization plans to build a tower in Moscow. Those plans were still active in the summer of 2016, after Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination, Cohen revealed.\n\nSkips first world war events\n\nTrump travels to Paris to mark the centenary of the end of first world war but he skips a ceremony at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial near Paris “due to scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather”. The next day he misses a procession of world leaders to mark the occasion.\n\nTeargas attack on migrants\n\nTrump defends the use of teargas against migrants, including many young children, at the southern border after some migrants attempted to cross the border. “They had to be used because they were being rushed by some very tough people,” Trump said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A migrant family, part of a caravan from Central America, run away from teargas in front of the US-Mexico border wall in Tijuana on 25 November. Photograph: Kim Kyung Hoon/Reuters\n\n‘Dangerously wrong’ on California fires\n\nTrump blames poor “forest management” in his first comments on the deadliest wildfires in California history. Local elected officials and agencies fighting the fires call the comment “inane”, “uninformed” and “dangerously wrong”.\n\nManafort plea deal crumbles\n\nProsecutors and lawyers for Paul Manafort announce that an agreement between the sides has crumbled. Prosecutors accuse Manafort of continued lying which he denies.\n\nDecember\n\nMueller describes Flynn cooperation\n\nIn a heavily redacted court filing, Mueller shields the details of former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s cooperation because they include “sensitive information about ongoing investigations”. He recommends no prison time for Flynn.\n\nTrump ‘directed’ Cohen – prosecutors\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York say Trump directed Cohen to make hush payments that resulted in felony campaign finance convictions for Cohen. Trump denies any criminality.\n\nCohen sentenced to three years\n\nA federal judge sentences Michael Cohen to three years in prison and three years of supervised release for campaign finance violations, bank fraud, tax evasion and lying to Congress. Cohen says Trump directed him to violate campaign finance laws.\n\nInaugural committee under investigation\n\nProsecutors in New York are investigating donations to Trump’s inaugural committee, which totaled $107m, and investigating how that money was spent, the Wall Street Journal is first to report.\n\nPrecipitous troop drawdowns, Mattis resignation\n\nWithout warning or much of an explanation, Trump announces the withdrawal of the US military and state department employees from Syria, asserting on Twitter that “we have defeated ISIS”. Two days later Trump announces US forces in Afghanistan will be halved. The defense secretary, Jim Mattis, resigns in protest.\n\nGovernment shutdown\n\nGoaded by Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, Trump makes a last-minute declaration he won’t sign Republican legislation to keep the government open and demands $5bn for a border wall. The lame-duck House Republican majority passes a bill that dies in the Senate. Trump blames Democrats for the shutdown.",

         "Six bullets . More than I can count on one hand . That is how many times preliminary autopsy reports indicate that Michael Brown was shot . Nothing about the youthful infraction of strolling down the middle of a residential street in one ’ s own neighborhood justifies having your life ripped away from you by an irate officer firing six bullets as you face him , hands up in surrender .\nI can not even fathom what Mike , “ Big Mike ” as his friends call him , felt as each of those bullets entered his flesh . I do know a little of the rage , despair , helplessness and hopelessness that black communities have been left to feel in the aftermath of his death . I know he stayed conscious long enough to put his hands up , to try and surrender , as if to say , “ I want to live . Please don ’ t kill me . ”\nFerguson residents and protesters now find themselves arms outstretched , palms up , yelling “ don ’ t shoot , ” as police officers in guns , gas masks and tanks occupy the streets of Ferguson , Missouri , dropping canisters of tear gas on our American dreams . Those of us not yet there in Ferguson watch helplessly as the images of at least one child being tear-gassed come through our Twitter feeds , as journalists find themselves facing down the barrel of a hastily drawn police weapon or thrown in jail , as police drop stun grenades on crowds that refuse to comply with the unreasonable demand that they relinquish their right to peaceful assembly .\nWhile the world watches aghast , America ’ s penchant for exporting guns , tanks and destruction to other places in the name of law and order has shown up on our own doorsteps , in our backyards , with people pinned into parking lots and onto their porches . They are told they must stay where they are or risk being shot with rubber bullets or have their faces and lungs sting with the inhalation of tear gas .\nPublic space in Ferguson is awash in black tears , but it is the sirens that we hear wailing . The people would weep , but they are too busy running , ducking and taking cover from the angry sounds of a system that does not love them , does not care about their meager “ rights . ”\nMeanwhile , the government attempts to placate the people with optical sleights of hand . Capt . Ron Johnson , by all accounts a sincere and affable leader and head of the highway patrol , replaced the police chief late last week , with promises that he would not employ military tactics to police the citizens of Ferguson . On Thursday I breathed a bit easier as we watched him giving hugs to protesters , marching with the people , allowing black women of faith to lay hands on him and pray .\nThat peace was short-lived after the Ferguson police inflamed crowds by releasing irrelevant footage of a conflict that Michael Brown had at a local convenience store when he and his friend Dorian went to buy Cigarellos . Late that evening the crowds returned , only to be met by more tanks , more tear gas , more guns .\nBeyond shock , I continue to be appalled at the extensive lengths to which the police have gone to protect Officer Darren Wilson and his family from any public reproach or reprisal in Mike ’ s death . They delayed the release of his name in order to provide him enough time to leave town .

         "Six bullets. More than I can count on one hand. That is how many times preliminary autopsy reports indicate that Michael Brown was shot. Nothing about the youthful infraction of strolling down the middle of a residential street in one’s own neighborhood justifies having your life ripped away from you by an irate officer firing six bullets as you face him, hands up in surrender.\n\nI cannot even fathom what Mike, “Big Mike” as his friends call him, felt as each of those bullets entered his flesh. I do know a little of the rage, despair, helplessness and hopelessness that black communities have been left to feel in the aftermath of his death. I know he stayed conscious long enough to put his hands up, to try and surrender, as if to say, “I want to live. Please don’t kill me.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nFerguson residents and protesters now find themselves arms outstretched, palms up, yelling “don’t shoot,” as police officers in guns, gas masks and tanks occupy the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, dropping canisters of tear gas on our American dreams. Those of us not yet there in Ferguson watch helplessly as the images of at least one child being tear-gassed come through our Twitter feeds, as journalists find themselves facing down the barrel of a hastily drawn police weapon or thrown in jail, as police drop stun grenades on crowds that refuse to comply with the unreasonable demand that they relinquish their right to peaceful assembly.\n\nWhile the world watches aghast, America’s penchant for exporting guns, tanks and destruction to other places in the name of law and order has shown up on our own doorsteps, in our backyards, with people pinned into parking lots and onto their porches. They are told they must stay where they are or risk being shot with rubber bullets or have their faces and lungs sting with the inhalation of tear gas.\n\nPublic space in Ferguson is awash in black tears, but it is the sirens that we hear wailing. The people would weep, but they are too busy running, ducking and taking cover from the angry sounds of a system that does not love them, does not care about their meager “rights.”\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMeanwhile, the government attempts to placate the people with optical sleights of hand. Capt. Ron Johnson, by all accounts a sincere and affable leader and head of the highway patrol, replaced the police chief late last week, with promises that he would not employ military tactics to police the citizens of Ferguson. On Thursday I breathed a bit easier as we watched him giving hugs to protesters, marching with the people, allowing black women of faith to lay hands on him and pray.\n\nThat peace was short-lived after the Ferguson police inflamed crowds by releasing irrelevant footage of a conflict that Michael Brown had at a local convenience store when he and his friend Dorian went to buy Cigarellos. Late that evening the crowds returned, only to be met by more tanks, more tear gas, more guns.\n\nBeyond shock, I continue to be appalled at the extensive lengths to which the police have gone to protect Officer Darren Wilson and his family from any public reproach or reprisal in Mike’s death. They delayed the release of his name in order to provide him enough time to leave town. They then released his name to coincide with video of the Cigarello incident, which they later admitted he knew nothing about when he stopped Mike. It is clear that the police are closing ranks, showing that they value the lives of their own more than the lives of citizens.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWe are told repeatedly that police are worthy of our respect because they risk their lives each day to protect us. That is not the case for black people. When we encounter police, our lives are at risk while they protect themselves. I started to temper my statement by saying “some police,” but that gives the impression that I am speaking of the actions of a few rogue officers.

         "How the New York Times Proved Trump’s Case for Firing James Comey",
         "2017-05-11",
         "Aaron Klein",
         "In an extensive article published last month that included interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement officials , congressional officials and other government employees , the New York Times published a stinging indictment of James B. Comey ’ s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe .\nThe Times made the case that Comey violated FBI tradition , bypassed the Justice Department and went rogue on several occasions in a manner that clearly impacted the 2016 presidential election .\nIn a letter on Tuesday from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired , Rosenstein specifically cited Comey ’ s alleged mishandling of the Clinton email probe as justification for Comey ’ s removal from office .\n“ I can not defend the Director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of secretary Clinton ’ s emails , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ And I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken . Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes ; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives . ”\nRosenstein continued : “ The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General ’ s authority on July 5 , 2016 , and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution . It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement . At most , the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors . ”\nThat is precisely the case made by the Times ’ April 22 article , titled , “ Comey Tried to Shield the F.B.I . From Politics .

         "In an extensive article published last month that included interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement officials, congressional officials and other government employees, the New York Times published a stinging indictment of James B. Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe.\n\nThe Times made the case that Comey violated FBI tradition, bypassed the Justice Department and went rogue on several occasions in a manner that clearly impacted the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn a letter on Tuesday from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired, Rosenstein specifically cited Comey’s alleged mishandling of the Clinton email probe as justification for Comey’s removal from office.\n\n“I cannot defend the Director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of secretary Clinton’s emails,” Rosenstein wrote. “And I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.”\n\nRosenstein continued: “The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General’s authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement. At most, the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors.”\n\nThat is precisely the case made by the Times’ April 22 article, titled, “Comey Tried to Shield the F.B.I. From Politics. Then He Shaped an Election.”\n\nThe Times says that for its article it interviewed “more than 30 current and former law enforcement, congressional and other government officials.”\n\nThe newspaper concluded that Comey’s decision to inform Congress that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email probe less than two weeks before the presidential election “violate[ed] the policies of an agency that does not reveal its investigations or do anything that may influence an election.”\n\nThe article related that Comey decided to plunge the FBI “into the molten center of a bitter election” in part because he feared “the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I. had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret.”\n\nFailed to seek Lynch recusal\n\nA significant motivating factor for Comey’s rogue approach toward the Clinton email probe, the Times revealed, was his distrust of senior officials at the Justice Department, especially then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, whom, the newspaper reported, “Mr. Comey believed had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation.”\n\nIndeed, according to the Times, Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Hillary Clinton in the email probe.\n\nThe FBI had further information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence, leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the U.S. government’s Clinton email probe, the Times reported.\n\nIn his letter from Tuesday, Rosenstein argues that if Comey believed Lynch to be compromised he should have sought her recusal instead of taking matters into his own hands.\n\n“The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Lynch had a conflict,” Rosenstein wrote. “But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General.”\n\nIndeed, according to the Times, after it became clear that the F.B.I. did not discover Clinton emails showing intent to mishandle classified information – the agency believed those emails were among the correspondence deleted by Clinton – Comey made the decision to bypass the Justice Department and explain the case to the public.\n\nThe paper reported:\n\nNine months into the investigation, it became clear to Mr. Comey that Mrs. Clinton was almost certainly not going to face charges. He quietly began work on talking points, toying with the notion that in the midst of a bitter presidential campaign, a Justice Department led by Democrats may not have the credibility to close the case, and that he alone should explain that decision to the public.\n\nComey’s decision was further fueled by the alleged document written by a Democratic operative hacked by the Russians, a document that in Comey’s view raised “questions about [Lynch’s] independence,” the Times reported.\n\nInstead of seeking Lynch’s recusal, as Rosenstein would later outline as the proper course of action, Comey decided to go at it alone, take matters into his own hands and make his public pronouncements about Clinton’s email case without the Justice Department.\n\nThe Times cited former Justice officials as “deeply skeptical” of Comey’s alleged reasoning:\n\nFormer Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account.

The Times article related that after the tarmac episode, Comey “knew for sure that when there was something to say about the case, he alone would say it.”\n\nMade legal conclusions\n\nAfterwards, Comey held the press conference at which he criticized Clinton’s private email server as “extremely careless” before finally stating that “no charges are appropriate in this case.”\n\nWith his pronouncements, Comey offered judgments and legal conclusions many argue are out of the purview of the FBI, which is charged with documenting the evidence and handing it over to the Justice Department.\n\nThe Times cited unnamed “frustrated” prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them.\n\nWent rogue a second time despite FBI tradition\n\nComey’s injection into the presidential race did not end there. Less than two weeks before the election, the FBI discovered a trove of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of long-time top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin.

         "“ Trump has betrayed the Syrian Kurds ” — so goes a popular refrain regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the areas of northeast Syria held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) . The events that have followed — namely , a Turkish invasion of parts of SDF territory along the border and the deployment of Syrian government forces in some SDF areas — have been characterized as a strategic disaster for American interests , with some commentators even proclaiming the withdrawal as indicative of a U.S. imperial decline and U.S. disengagement from the Middle East .\nIn fact , much of this is overblown . For one thing , the U.S. still maintains extensive troop deployments elsewhere in the Middle East , and those are not being drawn down anytime soon . Insofar as many of the pundits , analysts , and policymakers condemning Trump consider the recent developments in Syria to be a disaster , they primarily have themselves to blame , however popular bashing Trump might be .\nIndeed , these critics of Trump did not learn the relevant lessons from December 2018 when the president ordered preparations for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria . They should have appreciated that Trump is ultimately the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces and that he had made his own preferences on Syria clear : namely , that after the military defeat of the Islamic State , U.S. forces should leave . As the president ’ s record on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal illustrates , he has generally been forthright and sincere in trying to fulfill his policy promises . When he told his advisers that he wanted to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria , he meant it . The message should have been clear : devise an orderly withdrawal plan .\nBut that is not what happened . Instead , efforts and attention were geared towards U.S. forces remaining indefinitely in Syria . The advocates for this “ stay indefinitely ” approach argued that the deployment as it existed was supposedly an example of a successful projection of U.S. leverage and influence with a relatively small number of troops . They claimed that U.S. presence was vital for political negotiations on Syria ’ s future and important for limiting Iranian influence and blocking its “ land route ” to the Mediterranean .\nIn reality , none of these assertions holds up but rather reflect dubious expansions of the original purpose of the U.S. mission in Syria : countering the Islamic State . At the same time , the “ stay indefinitely ” crowd tended to downplay the major problem regarding the U.S. partnership with the SDF : the issue of relations with Turkey , which considers ( with some justification ) the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , which has fought the Turkish state for decades .\nRegardless of what one thinks of Turkey ’ s approach towards the PKK , it is not a problem that can be treated as a minor irritant . Facts of geography mean that Turkey is located along the northern borders of the SDF ’ s territory . As such , Turkey could be the SDF ’ s main gateway to the outside world , rather than the small and limited capacity border crossing on the Tigris River that the SDF has maintained with the Iraqi Kurdistan region . Thus , for the interests of the SDF ’ s longterm economic prospects ( among other things ) , some kind of détente or resolution of the conflict between the PKK and Turkey would have been necessary so that the region could have much more open borders and engagement with the outside world .\nUnfortunately , though , policymakers and advisers did not take Turkey ’ s concerns and its threats of a military confrontation with the SDF seriously enough . Along with their desire to keep U.S. troops in Syria , many of them imagined that Turkey could somehow be appeased through half-baked measures : thus the previous attempts to deny SDF–PKK links , the failed schemes of joint U.S.–Turkish patrols in the Manbij area west of the Euphrates River , and then the joint northern border patrols and partial dismantling of SDF fortifications along the northern border with Turkey a little while before the recent Turkish incursion against the SDF .\nOthers argue that the U.S. simply needed to be adamant in saying no to a Turkish incursion and that the small U.S. troop presence could have deterred Turkey indefinitely . This view is implausible . A small foreign troop presence can function as a deterrent to another side ’ s attack , but it is not an absolute deterrent here . To understand why , consider events that occurred earlier this year on the other side of Syria . In the northwest of Syria ( specifically the city of Idlib and its environs ) , Turkey set up multiple small military outposts in the insurgent-held areas ostensibly as part of enforcing a “ deescalation ” scheme in coordination with Russia . In practice , the goal has been to block any further Syrian government offensives on the northwest and prevent further refugee flows into Turkey .\nWhile Russia has shown some understanding of Turkey ’ s concerns in this regard , it also wishes to assist the Syrian government in restoring its control over the area and will not tolerate the indefinite presence of designated “ terrorist ” groups harassing Syrian government and Russian positions . Russia thus gave Turkey time to clear a demilitarized buffer zone of the likes of Hay ’ at Tahrir al-Sham ( a designated “ terrorist ” group ) . When that did not materialize and the insurgent harassments of Syrian government and Russian positions continued , the Syrian government and Russia launched a military campaign that retook important areas in south Idlib and north Hama . The Turkish military outposts did not do anything to stop the offensive ( indeed , they could not do so ) , and in effect the Syrian government and Russia worked around one of the outposts in north Hama . A ceasefire then followed , but it should be clear that it will not last if Turkey can not crack down on the groups that are designated as “ terrorist . ”\nThat episode should also have been a lesson for U.S. policymakers . Turkey ’ s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly said he would launch an incursion against the SDF to the east of the Euphrates River ( where U.S. forces in Syria have primarily been stationed ) , and in 2018 Turkey had carried through with its threats to destroy the SDF enclave in the Afrin area , where the U.S. had no presence . What would have stopped Turkey from finding ways to work around U.S. positions as part of its incursion against the SDF east of the Euphrates River and essentially forcing the small U.S. garrisons — confronted by much larger Turkish forces and their Syrian insurgent proxies — to get out of the way ?\nThus , Trump ’ s indication to Erdoğan that he wished to leave Syria and would not oppose an incursion likely hastened the Turkish operations against the SDF . But it was not the decisive factor in determining whether or not those operations would have eventually occurred anyway . Had the U.S. wished to deter Turkey indefinitely , it would have had to deploy far more troops in northeast Syria . For comparison , the much more extensive Turkish military presence in the insurgent-held north Aleppo countryside between Afrin and Jarabulus functions as an effective deterrent against Russian and Syrian government military action so long as Turkey maintains that large presence .\nOf course , the advocates of the “ stay indefinitely ” course did not dare to confront these realities and argue for a more extensive U.S. presence , knowing that such advocacy would be politically unacceptable . They preferred to argue that the small U.S. troop presence in northeast Syria as an example of a deployment that was strategically effective and inexpensive .\nUltimately , the debate about the U.S. role in Syria boils down to the question of how far the U.S. should invest troops and resources into a foreign deployment . Those who advocated an indefinite presence are delusional if they think the prior status quo was sustainable . If they had thought more carefully about the idea of making the SDF-held areas a U.S. protectorate that could function independently of the wider environment , they should have accepted that such a project would have required far more troops and money to be poured in .\nIn any case , they should still be asked why they did not come up with an exit plan but instead thought they could defy the president ’ s wishes . They are the ones far more deserving of the accusation of betrayal for making misleading commitments , promises , and reassurances to the SDF .",

         "President Donald Trump 's son-in-law has said neither he nor anyone in the Trump campaign team colluded with Russian officials over the US election .\nJared Kushner said he had no improper contacts and did not rely on Russian funds to finance business activities .\nMr Kushner released his opening statement ahead of giving testimony before a Senate panel on Monday .\nThe Senate , the House and a special counsel are all investigating Russian interference in the election .\nMr Kushner , 36 , is a senior adviser to the president and was in charge of the Trump campaign 's digital strategy . He is married to Mr Trump 's daughter , Ivanka .\nMr Kushner , who keeps a very low media profile , was due to attend a closed-door session on Monday before the Senate Intelligence Committee , and then appear before the House version on Tuesday .\nIn the statement to both congressional committees he released on Monday , he says : `` I did not collude , nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded , with any foreign government . ''\n`` With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign , there were hardly any , '' he says . At the end of the statement he speaks of `` perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives '' both during the campaign and after .\nHe does refer to a meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June last year . She had allegedly promised damaging material on Hillary Clinton .\nMr Kushner said he arrived late at the meeting , realised little of note was being discussed and that it was `` time not well-spent '' .\nHe said : `` I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for 10 or so minutes and wrote 'Can u pls call me on my cell ? Need excuse to get out of meeting ' . ''\nMr Trump Jr said former campaign chief Paul Manafort was also at the meeting and that no compromising material on Mrs Clinton was provided .\nIn his Senate testimony Jared Kushner says he has nothing to hide and is `` happy '' to share information with those investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign .\nHis written statement , however , is an exercise in caution and lawyerly discretion . He addresses only the controversies already in the public sphere , then offers his explanation for why they are no big deal .\nHe receives hundreds of emails a day and did n't read his brother-in-law 's forwarded message that said the Russian government wanted to help the Trump campaign .\nReports of an effort to set up back-channel communications with Russia after the election were a halted effort to get information about Syria from Russian generals .\nHe met with an influential Russian banker because the Russian ambassador - whose name he could n't initially remember - was so persistent .\nThe incomplete security form was the result of a `` miscommunication '' with an assistant who submitted it too soon .\nBeyond that , there are no new revelations ; no new disclosures . If what 's already out is all there is , Mr Kushner and his lawyers have done their best to defuse the bombs . When walking in a minefield , it 's the ones you do n't know about that pose the greatest risk .\nOne matter on which Mr Kushner may face a grilling is his security clearance declaration , as he accepts he failed initially to reveal his contacts with Russians .\nHe says the first form , a `` rough draft that still had many omissions '' , was filed by an assistant in error on 18 January and that declarations on his foreign contacts , not just with Russians , were added over the next six months `` in the normal course '' .\nAmbassador Sergei Kislyak ( above ) .

         "Jim Acosta of CNN and other media personalities get exercised when the President calls Fake News the “ enemy of the people. ” President Trump does not call all news outlets or personalities by that term — only the Fake News . Certainly , that term is quite an incendiary sobriquet . The President reciprocates with it because he gets attacked with incendiary abuse . No American President in memory has been picked on and lied about with the intensity and frequency that President Trump has had to endure .\nThe media — because it is almost-monolithically Left-Democrat — regularly depicted Ronald Reagan as a moron , occasionally tying him to a movie in which he acted , Bedtime for Bonzo , where he went to bed in one scene alongside a chimpanzee . ( They forget that he was cast in the film as a university professor . ) Reagan endured it , avoided reciprocal name-calling , and history unequivocally has registered that he actually was quite brilliant , understood what so many others could not grasp , revived the moribund Jimmy Carter economy with creative strategies and tax-cutting boldness that George H.W . Bush myopically had called “ Voodoo Economics , ” stared down Mikhail Gorbachev and defeated a century of Communism , and launched an anti-ballistic military focus that his enemies mocked as “ Star Wars ” but that today is central to protecting Western democracies from incoming ballistic missiles . The “ Iron Dome ” missile-defense system that Israel has used so effectively against Gaza Hamas terrorist rockets is the fruit of “ Star Wars . ”\nThe Left Media almost universally depicted the brilliant Reagan as an idiot , and he somehow shrugged it off . Donald Trump is different because we do not manufacture our Presidents with interchangeable parts on an assembly line . It very well may be that the past week ’ s Pittsburgh terrorist attack , and the way the President responded , and the way the Left Media then hit the President viciously anyway is the “ Rosetta Stone ” — the small piece of archaeological evidence historians will need — to decipher that Donald Trump was right to call the Fake News Left Media the “ enemy of the people . ”\n1 . “ The People ” Benefit From a Robust and Independent Press — and a Fake News Regime Indeed Is the Enemy of the People\n“ The People ” indeed benefit from a robust “ press ” — more accurately called “ media ” in this digital age of televised news , digital internet-based news , and so much more than the mere newsprint “ press. ” If Stalin ’ s Soviet Russia had been covered by a robust media ( and if such media could have survived ) , “ The People ” would have learned that Stalin ’ s five-year economic plans disastrously were failing and were leading to mass starvation , moreover that he consciously was perpetrating genocide by starving millions of Ukrainians to death in the Golodomor , that he was putting millions of prisoners to work in tundra prisons to dig through ice manually to build canals and other infrastructure . An honest news media would have alerted the West , too , that Stalin was murdering millions . The New York Times had a sycophantically pro-Stalin liar , Walter Duranty , filing Fake News reports from the Soviet Union for more than ten years . The Times published the lies daily as “ news ” and made him their Moscow bureau chief for fourteen years . As a result , the West was lulled , cheated of the truth , made unaware of the evil . Yes , the Fake News indeed was the enemy of the people .\nLikewise , the New York Times— and the other mainstream media who took their lead from them — by and large refused to report on the unfolding Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews . Between 1939 and 1945 , the New York Times published more than 23,000 front-page stories . Of those , 11,500 were about World War II . Only twenty-six — in six years — were about the Holocaust . The Times was passively complicit .\nA robust newsmedia can save lives by exposing and revealing , while a Fake News regime can serve to assist in the despoiling of a people . When media foist false narratives to sow social discord , or when they assist tyranny with falsehoods , they indeed are the enemy of the people .\nSocial discord leads to streets being set on fire — witness Ferguson and Baltimore during the Obama Years . Social discord dispirits potentially valuable citizens who could help build a society , instead turning them against that society and motivating them to work towards its downfall or simply to drop out . In its worst aspect , social discord leads to armed insurrection and civil war . If the problem is that a Stalin is murdering millions by deliberately starving them while incarcerating millions others in slave camps in the Gulag , then insurrection and civil war can be righteous , potentially saving such a despoiled society . But when the society actually is doing quite well , when freedom reigns and people of all colors , creeds , religions , and ethnicities are enjoying remarkable opportunities to succeed and to live wonderfully rich and precious lives alongside their neighbors in respectful diversity , then Fake News media indeed are the enemy of the people when they seek to sow social discord in that welcome environment , aiming to up-end civil harmony .\nA maniacal dirtbag murdered eleven Jews in Pittsburgh . In time , perhaps after a decade or two of ACLU appeals , he will be electrocuted , injected , hanged , or hopefully all three . The dirtbag hated Jews , and he likewise hated President Trump . President Trump responded to the news immediately with profoundly sensitive and healing words aimed at condemning anti-Semitism and at comforting and consoling the Jewish community . Listen to his words . If the role of a President is to heal and unify , as President Reagan did after the Challenger tragedy , as President Bush did after 9-11 , then this President did so eloquently , sensitively . And then came the sowers of social discord to destroy the moment… .\nThe Left Media would not allow the President that moment to heal and unify . Instantly , they brought in one Left-Democrat anti-Trump “ analyst ” after another to blame Mr. Trump for the attack . They never blamed President Jimmy Carter ’ s anti-Jewish rhetoric for the 1977 Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue shooting in St. Louis . Nor Bill Clinton for the 1994 Brooklyn Bridge shootings of yeshiva students that included the murder of Ari Halberstam . Nor Clinton ’ s rhetoric for the 1999 Granada Hills Jewish Community Center shooting in Los Angeles . Nor Obama for the deadly 2009 Holocaust Museum shooting in Washington , D.C . Nor Obama for the 2014 Overland Park Jewish Community Center shootings in Kansas City that murdered three . But this time — with the same social dynamics as the others — they tried blaming the President . By sowing social discord with outright absolute falsehoods at a time that called for healing , the Left Media indeed were acting as enemy of the people .\nFacts are different from opinions . Facts can be discerned and evidenced . There is a reason that as many as 82 percent of Israeli Jews love President Trump , that more than 90 percent of American Orthodox Jews support President Trump . Likewise , a huge majority of British Jews — by more than three-to-one — support England ’ s conservative party and despise the Labour Socialists . Similarly , millions of Jews who have left the former Soviet Union hate Marxism and socialism , are solidly capitalist and conservative , indeed have changed the face of Israeli politics towards the more conservative Likud , now led by Benjamin Netanyahu . Throughout the world , Jews now vote conservative , are conservative — as reflected in our country , too , by American Orthodox Jews . The independent Pew Research Center has found that the Orthodox Jewish community will be the predominant Jewish community in a few decades , as the others disappear . Just as the voting patterns of the American Deep South have changed 180 degrees from Democrat to Republican in the century since the Civil War , so is the American Jewish metamorphosis now on pace to synchronize with every other Jewish community in the world that has moved towards conservatism . But Jews are not monolithic , as witness those in Hollywood and in certain media .\nSo look at what the Fake News Left Media did after President Trump healed and unified : They received a news release from a small , utterly insignificant , nothing of a Radical Leftist group , calling itself “ Bend the Arc , ” which said that they did not want the President of the United States to visit Pittsburgh . The thing is , those Radical Leftists do not want the President to visit anywhere . Just as there are rabid Leftist Catholics ( not to mention the more mainstream Leftist Nancy Pelosi , Joe Biden , and the Kennedys ) and rabid Leftist Protestants , these also are rabid Leftists . Within the normative mainstream American Jewish community , “ Bend the Arc ” is a joke , off the charts . Their CEO started off as a sex-club “ dancer. ” C ’ mon ! As reported : “ Cotler , who identifies as queer , recounted how a lesbian couple invited her to their [ event ] after she did a table dance for them at what she refers to as a ‘ sex club. ’ ” Feh !\nSo this Leftist fringe group issues their statement — and the Fake News Left Media then falsely report that “ the Jews of Pittsburgh ” ( not “ some Jews ” ) do not want the President to visit . Consider these headlines — and they are a mere sampling :\n“ ‘ You Are Not Welcome ’ : Jewish Community Leaders Do Not Want President Trump To Come To Pittsburgh ” ( Salon )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Stay Away Unless He Denounces White Nationalism ” ( NY Daily News )\n“ Trump ‘ Not Welcome ’ In Pittsburgh After Synagogue Shooting ” ( Al Jazeera )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Denounce White Nationalism ” ( Reuters )\nAll those stories thereupon cite the same insignificant radical-fringe “ Bend the Arc ” statement . Honestly — if there still is such a thing as honesty — that is outright Fake News . I know the American Jewish community . I have been a Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America , a congregational rabbi for decades , sat for six years during this past decade on the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America , have sat on committees of Jewish Federations and Boards of Hillels , have a whole lifetime résumé in this area . My rabbinical colleagues and I were bristling all day , reading and hearing this Fake News . The rabbi of the temple where the murders happened , Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers , explicitly welcomed a visit by the President . To report such lies , at a time of such intense passion , is to stoke flames among the populace . It is not unfair to call such liars “ Enemies of the People . ”\nThey do it similarly to convince Americans of Color that this President hates them . He beams so proudly that he has helped reduce poverty and unemployment in the African-American community . Likewise , in the Latino and Greater Hispanic communities . It is a hallmark of his every speech . How compare him to Hitler , for G-d ’ s sakes ? Why sow social discord between and among races when the President , despite his classical Trumpian gaffes , actually takes so much pride in his being a President for all Americans , in a country where — in his trademark line — “ we all bleed the same red , white , and blue ” ? Why denigrate his outreach to Black Americans , whether via Kanye West and Jim Brown or by speaking to a Young Black Leadership Summit ? Why begin narrating his Presidency on Day One by reporting falsely , as Zeke Miller of Time magazine did , the lie that he had removed a bust of the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office ? Why publish falsehoods to sow discord among the Black and Latino communities — if not to aim cynically to peel away their votes — by trying falsely to report that he is a bigot who hates them ? Here is a man who was in the public eye , in the world ’ s media center in the heart of Manhattan , with a weekly network television show , building skyscrapers and hotels , golf courses and casinos — all bearing his name — and no stain of racism or bigotry of such sort ever got attached to him through all those decades in the limelight . Why cause enmity and divide the nation , disillusion African Americans and Latinos from recognizing that this President seeks their advancement alongside that of everyone else ? Only to sow civil discord , to promote tension and unrest in the name of advancing an agenda that assures greater television ratings , higher advertising dollars , and a change in the elected government chosen of The People , by The People , and for The People .\n3 . The Proof the Pudding : Tagging the Most Pro-Jewish President in American History as an Anti-Semite .\nSo it comes back to the Rosetta Stone — the way the Left Media falsely portrays this President ’ s relationship with one demographic , the Jews , demonstrating a pattern of Left Media mendacity aimed at sowing social discord throughout . Even before he was elected President , the Left Media was calling him an anti-Semite by clutching at straws to prove the false narrative . Just as they did by propping up “ Bend the Arc ” into a Fake News depiction as “ Jewish Leaders , ” they regularly dig up the most irrelevant and unrepresentative people from the Far Left who are JINOs— Jews In Name Only — as “ experts ” on Trump and anti-Semitism . It does not end . These are lies , damned lies , and more damned lies being perpetuated by enemies of the people . Just consider these facts about the Trump Administration and the Jews :\nThis is an anti-Semite ? If so , may G-d smite us with an abundance of such anti-Semites ! Although his daughter , Ivanka , and son-in-law Jared Kushner are Orthodox Jews — as are their children , his grandchildren — that family connection in itself is not determinative . After all , we are told that George Soros is a Jew , and most every Jew I know would gladly trade Soros for two anti-Semites and a neo-Nazi to be named later . Soros is a major opponent of Israel and secretly funds organizations that oppose critical Israel policies . But the demonstrated life record of President Trump , a lifetime of working closely with Jews , amicably and warmly , makes him someone whom Jews throughout the world appreciate deeply . Again — every survey and poll of Jews who actually live the Jewish observances , the kosher laws , the Sabbath , the Torah demonstrates that he is warmly regarded in that community .\nThe Fake News about Trump and Jews is the Rosetta Stone . Once one cracks that hidden code , everything else becomes clear . The Left Media indeed propound Fake News , lies , and falsehoods . They undertake to stoke anger among African Americans , among Latinos , among women . The People rely on them for the news , the truth — and , yes , for honest reporting when the President is wrong because The People benefit when they are told the truth , even when the truth is not pretty . But to depict him as an agent of Putin , as a man perpetrating treason , a hater ?\nThese are the lies that come only from Enemies of the People .",

         "Something extraordinary happened in Congress before they took their month-long August break . No , not that they passed a bill , though that has become a rare feat these days . This Congress , so obsessed with the deficit that they imposed a spending cap on themselves , and vowed that no new legislation would ever pass without being paid for , did just that last Thursday . Moreover , the same Republican House that has taken several dozen votes to repeal Obamacare passed this deficit-spending bill to further fund the country ’ s only system of socialized medicine .\nHow did this happen ? Because when you support the troops , federal spending is magic spending that doesn ’ t count .\nThe bill , signed by the president last Thursday , seeks to reform the Veterans Administration , though you can make a credible case that the new spending represents an attempt to undermine it . We ’ re only talking about an infinitesimal sliver of the federal budget , $ 10 billion in new spending spread out over a couple of years . But if the government allows itself to spend in reaction to an emergency without having to pay for it , suddenly a whole host of options come into play . It overturns so many false ideas that have perniciously made their way into the mainstream over the past several years , from the virtues of austerity to the inadequacies of economic stimulus . And it exposes how anything that has to do with the military gets a free pass , one that should be extended to all kinds of worthy policies .\nUnder the legislation passed by Congress , the $ 10 billion will go toward vouchers that enable any VA patient who experiences long wait times or lives more than 40 miles from the nearest VA facility to access private medical coverage . Another $ 6.3 billion in the bill goes toward hiring more VA doctors , upgrading current VA health centers , and entering into leases with 27 major medical facilities across the country .\nThat $ 6.3 billion gets paid for internally with offsets from the VA budget . But Congress was taken by surprise , amazingly , at the cost of private medical care . The Congressional Budget Office scored the private coverage aspect of the initial bill as costing $ 35 billion between now and 2016 . According to CBO , covering private care would cost $ 25 billion just in 2016 , when the entire VA budget costs $ 44 billion annually .\nCongressional negotiators got their hands around the cost by turning it into a pilot program , with a fixed limit to the spending . And it will be worth tracking to see how long it takes for that funding to dry up when routed through the inefficient and wasteful private healthcare system . In reality , only 0.6 percent of VA enrollees ever experienced wait times over 90 days ; this was a political rather than a policy problem . And it ’ s worth noting that many veterans advocates would rather have more money put into the specialized VA system than into back-door privatization , especially if growing the private care benefit means eroding the VA .\nBut Congress still had the bigger problem of how to fund that $ 10 billion , with the clock ticking before the statutorily mandated August recess ( that ’ s right , Congress is obligated by law to go on vacation after July 31 ) . So in the end , they decided not to pay for it .\nThey would not be able to get away with that , politically , with virtually any other priority of the federal government . Spending for national parks , medical research through the National Institutes of Health , food stamps , housing vouchers , anything else you can name , would require an offset . The Budget Control Act attempts to prevent Congress from spending above a top-line number on the discretionary budget for the next several years . Sequestration , most of which remains in effect , cuts spending rigidly without allowances . Paygo legislation disallows spending without offsets ; efforts like the VA bill require a special vote to waive that statute .

         "Something extraordinary happened in Congress before they took their month-long August break. No, not that they passed a bill, though that has become a rare feat these days. This Congress, so obsessed with the deficit that they imposed a spending cap on themselves, and vowed that no new legislation would ever pass without being paid for, did just that last Thursday. Moreover, the same Republican House that has taken several dozen votes to repeal Obamacare passed this deficit-spending bill to further fund the country’s only system of socialized medicine.\n\nHow did this happen? Because when you support the troops, federal spending is magic spending that doesn’t count.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe bill, signed by the president last Thursday, seeks to reform the Veterans Administration, though you can make a credible case that the new spending represents an attempt to undermine it. We’re only talking about an infinitesimal sliver of the federal budget, $10 billion in new spending spread out over a couple of years. But if the government allows itself to spend in reaction to an emergency without having to pay for it, suddenly a whole host of options come into play. It overturns so many false ideas that have perniciously made their way into the mainstream over the past several years, from the virtues of austerity to the inadequacies of economic stimulus. And it exposes how anything that has to do with the military gets a free pass, one that should be extended to all kinds of worthy policies.\n\nUnder the legislation passed by Congress, the $10 billion will go toward vouchers that enable any VA patient who experiences long wait times or lives more than 40 miles from the nearest VA facility to access private medical coverage. Another $6.3 billion in the bill goes toward hiring more VA doctors, upgrading current VA health centers, and entering into leases with 27 major medical facilities across the country.\n\nThat $6.3 billion gets paid for internally with offsets from the VA budget. But Congress was taken by surprise, amazingly, at the cost of private medical care. The Congressional Budget Office scored the private coverage aspect of the initial bill as costing $35 billion between now and 2016. According to CBO, covering private care would cost $25 billion just in 2016, when the entire VA budget costs $44 billion annually.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nCongressional negotiators got their hands around the cost by turning it into a pilot program, with a fixed limit to the spending. And it will be worth tracking to see how long it takes for that funding to dry up when routed through the inefficient and wasteful private healthcare system. In reality, only 0.6 percent of VA enrollees ever experienced wait times over 90 days; this was a political rather than a policy problem. And it’s worth noting that many veterans advocates would rather have more money put into the specialized VA system than into back-door privatization, especially if growing the private care benefit means eroding the VA.\n\nBut Congress still had the bigger problem of how to fund that $10 billion, with the clock ticking before the statutorily mandated August recess (that’s right, Congress is obligated by law to go on vacation after July 31). So in the end, they decided not to pay for it.\n\nThey would not be able to get away with that, politically, with virtually any other priority of the federal government. Spending for national parks, medical research through the National Institutes of Health, food stamps, housing vouchers, anything else you can name, would require an offset. The Budget Control Act attempts to prevent Congress from spending above a top-line number on the discretionary budget for the next several years. Sequestration, most of which remains in effect, cuts spending rigidly without allowances. Paygo legislation disallows spending without offsets; efforts like the VA bill require a special vote to waive that statute. Not even unemployment insurance for the large segment of long-term unemployed workers can get by without an offset, which is why it has yet to be renewed.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMost reasonable people would consider being unemployed for months on end an emergency. But Congress finds it hard to rouse itself even with respect to unquestioned emergencies.

However, a controversial political figure from the past offering a few well-packaged words will not cause Kentuckians to forget how horrible Barack Obama's policies are making their lives right now,\" added Hogan Gidley, a Republican strategist who worked as a top aide to then-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, served as executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party, and was a senior adviser on Rick Santorum's 2012 White House bid.\n\nFamily ties\n\nGrimes is the daughter of a former Kentucky Democratic Party chairman who has long ties to Clinton. Jerry Lundergan was a major supporter of Clinton in both his presidential election victories and chaired Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign in Kentucky.\n\nOne thing that many of the candidates Bill Clinton's personally helped on the campaign trail the past couple of cycles have in common is that they backed his wife's 2008 White House bid.\n\nBut those with ties to the Clintons dismiss the notion that Bill Clinton's 2014 campaign moves are all about helping his wife if she runs in 2016.\n\n\"I think it's inaccurate to analyze his 2104 campaign schedule merely through the prism of 2016. President Clinton believes that campaigns matter because ideas matter, and wherever someone is running on the ideas he championed in the White House, he's going to want to campaign for them,\" said Begala, a senior adviser for Priorities USA, the super PAC set up to support Obama's 2012 re-election that's now raising money for a potential Clinton campaign.\n\n\"Everything the Clintons do from here on out will be perceived by as self-serving by some. As such, the same will be read into President Clinton helping fellow Democrats in 2014,\" admitted Cardona, before listing three reasons why this isn't the case in 2014.\n\nBut she added that \"the fact that it (Bill Clinton's 2014 campaign efforts) could ultimately help his wife if she runs, is a very nice added bonus.\"\n\nClinton & Bush family names an issue in 2016?\n\nCNN's Gabriella Schwarz contributed to this report",

         "Last week , Creshuna Miles , Juror No . 8 in the Michael Dunn trial , gave an interview to CNN about the jury ’ s partial verdict . Although she believes that Michael Dunn is guilty of second-degree murder , a lesser charge for which the jury had the option to convict , she insisted that the case was “ not about race , ” that it never came up . Moreover , she believed Michael Dunn to be essentially “ a good guy , ” who made “ bad choices . ”\nStartlingly , she also indicated that until Dunn ran down the street chasing Jordan ’ s three friends , she actually believed that Dunn acted in self-defense .\nPost-racial thinking is insidious not only because it gives lie to the very real and continuing material consequences of racism in this country , but also because it seduces young , optimistic , idealistic black youth into identifying with the very systems and people who would kill them without a second thought -- and then go order a pizza and a take a nap .\nPart of what Miles ’ impressions of Dunn reveal is that the defense did a far better job of humanizing Dunn for the jury than the prosecution did of humanizing Jordan for the jury .\nBut her impressions also reveal a deep disidentification with the seemingly retrograde racial politics that informed Dunn ’ s fatal engagement with Jordan Davis . Those 20th century-style racial politics take as a given that a group of young black men listening to rap music must be up to no good and that white harm is imminent .\nSuch thinking seems not to fit the cosmopolitan , progressive 21st century narrative of multiracial acceptance that ideological post-racialism pretends to be .\nI know that jury selection is a strategy .

But her fervent belief that the case was “ about justice , ” not “ about race , ” misses a fundamental truth about American society .

         "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on , though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question . So now , in order to preserve the broader framework — in which , for example , that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order , and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley .\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position , and the temporizing of others around her , I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done . There is still fierce opposition in some nearby quarters to what she has done , and she showed some degree of moral leadership when she called for state law to be quickly changed , so that the battle flag could be taken down . Yet , it ’ s equally clear that she has framed her argument well within the historical tradition of Southern white supremacist ideology — not in the heart of that tradition , to be sure , but still within the stifling folds of its garments .\nFor many people in our state the flag stands for traditions that are noble — traditions of history , of heritage , and of ancestry . The hate-filled murderer who massacred our brothers and sisters in Charleston has a sick and twisted view of the flag . In no way does he reflect the people in our state who respect and in many ways revere it . Those South Carolinians view the flag as a symbol of respect , integrity and duty . They also see it as a memorial , a way to honor ancestors who came to the service of their state during time of conflict . That is not hate . Nor is it racism .\nIn short , Dylann Roof messed things up for all the rest of us , so — unfortunately — things have to change . Implicitly , that ’ s the real bottom line . Haley continued , with a brief nod to the obvious , before hurrying on :\nAt the same time , for many others in South Carolina , the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past . As a state , we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints . We do not need to declare a winner and a loser here .\nAnd so she declared a truce — the truce of false equivalency — as the pathway forward :\nWe respect freedom of expression . And that for those who wish to show their respect for the flag on their private property , no one will stand in your way . But the statehouse is different . And the events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way .\nThe willingness to change is easy to grab onto and praise , but the more troubling aspects , the multiple ways in which change — not to mention simple justice — are more challenging to properly grasp , identify and name , much less come to terms with . At least three starting points can easily be identified , however . The first came from Ta-Nehisi Coates . Honing in on the underlying claim that Roof 's views did not reflect those of South Carolinians more broadly , Coates quickly weighed in to say :\nIf the governor meant that very few of the flag ’ s supporters believe in mass murder , she is surely right . But on the question of whose view of the Confederate Flag is more twisted , she is almost certainly wrong . Roof ’ s belief that black life had no purpose beyond subjugation is “ sick and twisted ” in the exact same manner as the beliefs of those who created the Confederate flag were “ sick and twisted. ” The Confederate flag is directly tied to the Confederate cause , and the Confederate cause was white supremacy .\nThis is the plain historical reality , and Coates goes on to rolls out stanza after stanza in an impressive historical litany of authoritative voices repeatedly underscoring the point , beginning with the Confederate states ’ own explanations for war , starting with South Carolina , then Mississippi ( which was particularly blunt : “ Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world. ” ) , Louisiana , Alabama ( “ the election of Mr. Lincoln can not be regarded otherwise than … an open declaration of war ” ) and Texas .\nHe then goes on to quote notable individuals , such as Jefferson Davis , not only affirming the centrality of slavery to the Southern cause , but elaborating on their desire to extend slaveholding into Cuba , Mexico and elsewhere , as well as propounding their belief that the equality of white men was founded on the slavery of blacks , and thus would be irrevocably lost if slavery were to be abolished . Thus , white supremacy for the South was not simply an isolated belief in the inherent superiority of whites as a race , it was the foundation for an aggressive and self-styled “ progressive ” worldview , a whole self-contained system of thought . The flag is inextricably linked to all of that .\nAs a second starting point it ’ s also true that the Confederate battle flag was largely a relic until it was revived in response to the Civil Rights Movement — first with Strom Thurmond ’ s “ States Rights Party ” in 1948 , then with Georgia adopting a version in protest of Brown v. Board of Education in 1956 , and South Carolina six years later — though , tellingly , the flag went up a year before the act authorizing it . For almost a hundred years , the South got on just fine celebrating its heritage without benefit of the flag . Indeed , the flag was raised over South Carolina as a result of the Civil War centennial celebration . This revival of interest in the flag was clearly all about renewed defiance of the federal government , which was finally being prodded into making good on the Civil War Amendments , and ensuring the full citizenship of African-Americans . Hence , today , the “ heritage ” the flag actually stands for is that of the 1960s , not the 1860s . Good luck with that .\nA third , related point , made by Jeet Heer at the New Republic , is that the flag matters tremendously as exertion of raw power . Its reintroduction in response to the Civil Rights movement sent a clear message : “ The feds might try to help you , but remember who is the boss down here . We still rule. ” Flying everywhere throughout the South , it sends the constant message to black Southerners , that they are not safe , they are not in control of their own personal security , much less anything else . Whatever other stories Southern whites might tell themselves and others about the flag , this basic fact remains . Indeed , the rhetorical act of denying the flag ’ s white supremacist meaning only demonstrates further how completely whites control things .\nBeyond these three starting points , there ’ s a vast terrain to explore , in terms of the white supremacist legacy the flag stands for and how it has reshaped itself over time . There are at least four key elements that any such account would have to explore . First , is the matter of white supremacy itself as a matter of organized social policy — both in terms of what it supports ( slavery in one era , segregation in the next , etc . ) and what it opposes ( abolition , integration , “ big government ” ) — as well as the culture it both depends upon and reproduces . Second , is the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to another , both establishing purportedly new foundations , while simultaneously reinterpreting the past .\nIt originally expressed itself in terms of slavery , then segregation and now largely in terms of what sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva described as “ colorblind racism ” in his book `` Racism Without Racists : Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America . '' Third , is the way in which white supremacy naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against . Bonilla-Silva ’ s book has a great deal to say about this as well . Furthermore , the pretense that the battle flag represents Civil War-era heritage rather than Civil Rights-era hatred is a telling example of how this process unfolds . Fourth , is the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance , etc . Haley leaned very heavily on this aspect of white supremacy in the process of pretending to reject it . So let us briefly consider each of these in turn .\nFirst , let ’ s reflect on white supremacy as a matter of organized social policy . There is nothing particularly difficult for people today to look back on past forms of white supremacy and reject them . It ’ s easy nowadays to see slavery or segregation as evil . Even Rand Paul , defending segregation in principle , said it was a bad business decision . But what about white supremacy policies today ?\nWhile part of the impetus to remove the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina came from respect for the Rev . Clementa Pinckney , the long-serving , highly respected member of the South Carolina State Senate , this only scratched the surface of Pinckney ’ s politics , as pointed out by North Carolina NAACP leader the Rev . William Barber on Democracy Now ! recently :\nReverend Pinckney , as a colleague in ministry , was not just opposed to the flag , he was opposed to the denial of Medicaid expansion , where now the majority of the state is opposing Medicaid expansion where six out of 10 black people live . He was opposed to voter suppression , voter ID in South Carolina . He was opposed to those who have celebrated the ending of the Voting Rights Act , or the gutting of Section 4 , which means South Carolina is no longer a preclearance state , and the very district that he served in is vulnerable right now . He was opposed to the lack of funding for public education . He wanted to see living wages raised .\nEvery item Barber mentioned is felt more deeply by the black community , so it ’ s not hard to grasp what a true rejection of white supremacy would look like . One might say that this calls for “ activist government , ” but the white South was all in favor of activist government `` When Affirmative Action Was White , '' as Ira Katznelson ’ s 2006 book explained . Thus , Barber continued :\nSo I would say to my colleagues , let ’ s take down the flag — to the governor — but also , let ’ s put together an omnibus bill in the name of the nine martyrs . And all of the things Reverend Pinckney was standing for , if we say we love him and his colleagues , let ’ s put all of those things in a one big omnibus bill and pass that and bring it to the funeral on Friday or Saturday , saying we will expand Medicaid to help not only black people , but poor white Southerners in South Carolina , because it ’ s not just the flag . Lee Atwater talked about the Southern strategy , where policy was used as a way to divide us . And if we want harmony , we have to talk about racism , not just in terms of symbol , but in the substance of policies . The flag went up to fight policies . If we ’ re going to bring it down , we ’ re also going to have to change policies , and particularly policies that create disparate impact on black , brown and poor white people .\nThe phrase “ disparate impact , ” which Barber used , is key to how white supremacy operates in the post-segregation era . It ’ s not that the races are treated entirely differently , only that the odds , burdens , privileges and benefits change , depending on the color of your skin . Often this happens without any conscious awareness , which is why Bonilla-Silva ’ s phrase , “ racism without racists ” is so apt . This is really not difficult to grasp — unless you ’ ve got a vested interest in not grasping it . In which case , welcome to the world of our second topic , the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to the next , and how\nTransitions between eras are often abrupt in some respects — the swift abolition of slavery in the final years of the Civil War , for example — while taking decades to work out in other ways . In order to first establish , and then fully stabilize the segregationist era , the meaning and purpose of the Civil War itself had to be reinterpreted through a white supremacist lens . The story of how that transpired over a fifty-year period is the subject of `` Race and Reunion : The Civil War in American Memory '' by David W. Blight . As I summarized in my review :\nBlight explains three broad visions of Civil War memory - reconciliationist , emancipationist and white supremacist . The first was born in wartime responses to its terrible brutality , epitomized by Walt Whitman 's experience of tending the wounded and dying of both sides . The second sprang not just from the war , but also from the Emancipation Proclamation and the more than 200,000 black combatants who joined the fight . The third gradually reformulated itself after the shock of military defeat , eventually dominating reconciliationist thinking by sacrificing racial reconciliation for the sake of sectional reunion .\nIt was not surprising that the reconciliationist view came to dominate — politically , materially , the nation needed sectional reintegration in a much more immediate way than it needed anything for its black citizens — a calculus that would eventually change over time . What ’ s striking is the relative ease with which the white supremacist vision came to merge with and dominate the reconciliationist view .\nThis is not the exception , but the rule in American history : any moves toward reconciling differences inevitably become infected with white supremacist aims — unless , of course , they are founded on them to begin with , as the case with American Colonization Society and the movement surrounding it , more on that below . A similar process has taken place with the end of segregation and the discrediting of overt racism which the norm in that era throughout the South , as well as in much of the North . This is essence of what Bonilla-Silva reveals in `` Racism Without Racists '' : a set of beliefs has emerged with superficially broad appeal , but which harbors a “ hidden ” white supremacist impact . Bonilla-Silva identifies four central frames at the core of colorblind racism : `` The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information , '' Bonilla-Silva writes . The first — and what I take to be the most significant and distinctive frame — is “ abstract liberalism , ” which he explains as follows :\nThe frame of abstract liberalism involves using ideas associated with political liberalism ( e.g . `` equal opportunity , '' the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy ) and economic liberalism ( e.g. , choice , individualism ) in an abstract manner to explain racial matters .\nWhat abstract liberalism hides is virtually everything having to do with history and indeed all social science , outside the narrow framework of market economics . It hides all historical inequalities , which recent research suggests persists for as long as ten generations . It also hides subconscious racial preferences , which can create intense segregation without any overt centralized coercion . But above all , it creates the illusion of some idealized social order , which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “ reverse racism. ” In short , the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them : they are the “ real racists , ” not whites !\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles , but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone . These are “ naturalization , ” which “ allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences , ” “ cultural racism ” which “ relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘ Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education ’ or ‘ blacks have too many babies ’ to explain the standing of minorities in society ” and “ minimization of racism ” which “ suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities ' life chances ( ‘ It 's better now than in the past ’ or ‘ There is discrimination , but there are plenty of jobs out there ’ ) . ” All three of these frames have been used in past eras . For example , Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past , so segregation was something blacks could and should accept . Similarly , cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism . But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today .\nAs I indicated above , not only does Bonilla-Silva ’ s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another , it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “ naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against. ” Indeed , this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “ common sense ” emerges , responding to multiple different needs at once , most typically , a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible , and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible . The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude , even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact . Meanwhile , those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order , even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics .\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic , the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance and so forth . It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else , and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done . Not only does white supremacy lay down the law , if conflicts arise in response , white supremacy takes the lead in naming , identifying and analyzing them , leading to proposed white supremacist solutions . On a macro scale , this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale , from the lowliest parts on up to the whole .\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society . It was originally founded to bring together two politically disparate groups , Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders , both united by the belief that free blacks faced a miserable future in America , and would be better off in Africa . This granddaddy of all “ grand bargains ” was laughable on its face — there hundreds of thousands of free blacks , far more than could ever be returned to Africa , even if they had all wanted to go — which most emphatically did not . But it was extremely popular with political elites , precisely because of its centrist power to “ bring people together ” — white people , that is . In his book , `` Of One Blood : Abolitionism and the Origins of Racial Equality , '' historian Paul Goodman had this to say :\nBy 1817 , African colonization had become more than a speculative idea . In the next decade , hundreds of prominent Americans -- political leaders including Presidents Madison and Monroe and religious leaders in most of the large denominations , from Presbyterian Lyman Beecher of Massachusetts to Episcopalian bishop William Mead of Virginia—threw their prestige and influence behind the America Colonization Society ( ACS ) , which established the colony of Liberia in West Africa . One of the most impressive voluntary societies of its day , the ACS boasted over two hundred state and local auxiliaries by 1830 . It was quietly assisted by President Monroe and endorsed by state legislatures and the major religious denominations , as well as by an illustrious panoply of notables .\nAs Goodman goes on to describe , the 19th-Century abolitionist movement was born out of free blacks ’ opposition to the ACS . It was precisely their unwillingness to be “ reasonable ” which formed the foundation of resistance which eventually spread to white abolitionists , and over a period five decades , eventually resulted in emancipation . Yet , almost up until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation he himself continued to be a supporter of colonization — such was the power of this “ centrist ” white supremacist vision . In fact , the ACS lived on for almost 100 years after Lincoln ’ s death — it only shut down in 1964 !\nThere are many other instances in which the cause of black freedom only advanced by refusing to be “ reasonable ” or to live up to some purported virtue or another . That ’ s because white supremacy , in one form or another , has always had such an enormous say in dictating what it meant to be “ reasonable ” or virtuous . And so it ’ s been incumbent on blacks to learn to think outside the box — to find a broader framework of understanding on which to found their moral as well as their political analysis .\nThis is why Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , once spoke to the American Psychological Association , and came out proudly for the cause of what he called “ creative maladjustment ” :\nI am sure that we will recognize that there are some things in our society , some things in our world , to which we should never be adjusted . There are some things concerning which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will . We must never adjust ourselves to racial discrimination and racial segregation . We must never adjust ourselves to religious bigotry . We must never adjust ourselves to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few . We must never adjust ourselves to the madness of militarism , and the self-defeating effects of physical violence… . Thus , it may well be that our world is in dire need of a new organization , The International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment .\nSimilarly , King ’ s “ Letter From Birmingham Jail ” was all about rejecting the framework of passive , superficial words of peace , moderation and restraint which the white ministers of Birmingham sought to impose on him . Here is just a small section of the wisdom it contains :\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress . I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace , in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight , to a substantive and positive peace , in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality . Actually , we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension . We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive . We bring it out in the open , where it can be seen and dealt with .\nI could not help myself thinking about the profound wrong-headed of “ reasonable ” white supremacy as I heard Nikki Haley ’ s speech , which is why my enthusiasm for it was so dimmed . In perhaps her most deeply typical move , she said there didn ’ t have to be winners and losers . Folks who love the flag and folks who despise it can all get along just fine ! But , of course , that leaves the entire substantive agenda Reverend Barber spoke about dead on arrival — just as it was supposed to do . There is no real underlying intent to address and disown the evil of white supremacy . The only way that evil is faced is by projecting it onto the disowned Confederate son , Dylann Roof .\nA good way to understand what ’ s wrong with Haley ’ s speech is to compare it with a speech by a quintessential white Southerner , Strom Thurmond ’ s son , whose speech makes no such attempt to defend the blind worship of “ heritage. ” Here is what South Carolina State Senator Paul Thurmond said :\nI am aware of my heritage . But my appreciation for the things that my forebearers accomplished to make my life better doesn ’ t mean that I must believe that they always made the right decisions and , for the life of me , I will never understand how anyone could fight a civil war based , in part , on the desire to continue the practice of slavery . Think about it for just a second . Our ancestors were literally fighting to continue to keep human beings as slaves and continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will . I am not proud of this heritage . These practices were inhumane and were wrong , wrong , wrong .\nWhere Haley felt the need to comfort — even identify with — those who see the flag as a symbol of noble heritage , Paul Thurmond simply said , “ I am not proud. ” Simple as that . A clean break . And that , my friends , is what America needs , where white supremacy is concerned . A clean break — and then the real business of a creating a livable future for all of us can begin .",
         "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on, though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question. So now, in order to preserve the broader framework — in which, for example, that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order, and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.\n\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position, and the temporizing of others around her, I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done. There is still fierce opposition in some nearby quarters to what she has done, and she showed some degree of moral leadership when she called for state law to be quickly changed, so that the battle flag could be taken down. Yet, it’s equally clear that she has framed her argument well within the historical tradition of Southern white supremacist ideology — not in the heart of that tradition, to be sure, but still within the stifling folds of its garments.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHere's Haley:\n\nFor many people in our state the flag stands for traditions that are noble — traditions of history, of heritage, and of ancestry. The hate-filled murderer who massacred our brothers and sisters in Charleston has a sick and twisted view of the flag. In no way does he reflect the people in our state who respect and in many ways revere it. Those South Carolinians view the flag as a symbol of respect, integrity and duty. They also see it as a memorial, a way to honor ancestors who came to the service of their state during time of conflict. That is not hate. Nor is it racism.\n\nIn short, Dylann Roof messed things up for all the rest of us, so — unfortunately — things have to change. Implicitly, that’s the real bottom line. Haley continued, with a brief nod to the obvious, before hurrying on:\n\nAt the same time, for many others in South Carolina, the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past. As a state, we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints. We do not need to declare a winner and a loser here.\n\nAnd so she declared a truce — the truce of false equivalency — as the pathway forward:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWe respect freedom of expression. And that for those who wish to show their respect for the flag on their private property, no one will stand in your way. But the statehouse is different. And the events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way.\n\nThe willingness to change is easy to grab onto and praise, but the more troubling aspects, the multiple ways in which change — not to mention simple justice — are more challenging to properly grasp, identify and name, much less come to terms with. At least three starting points can easily be identified, however. The first came from Ta-Nehisi Coates. Honing in on the underlying claim that Roof's views did not reflect those of South Carolinians more broadly, Coates quickly weighed in to say:\n\nIf the governor meant that very few of the flag’s supporters believe in mass murder, she is surely right. But on the question of whose view of the Confederate Flag is more twisted, she is almost certainly wrong. Roof’s belief that black life had no purpose beyond subjugation is “sick and twisted” in the exact same manner as the beliefs of those who created the Confederate flag were “sick and twisted.” The Confederate flag is directly tied to the Confederate cause, and the Confederate cause was white supremacy.\n\nThis is the plain historical reality, and Coates goes on to rolls out stanza after stanza in an impressive historical litany of authoritative voices repeatedly underscoring the point, beginning with the Confederate states’ own explanations for war, starting with South Carolina, then Mississippi (which was particularly blunt: “Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world.”), Louisiana, Alabama (“the election of Mr. Lincoln cannot be regarded otherwise than … an open declaration of war”) and Texas.\n\nHe then goes on to quote notable individuals, such as Jefferson Davis, not only affirming the centrality of slavery to the Southern cause, but elaborating on their desire to extend slaveholding into Cuba, Mexico and elsewhere, as well as propounding their belief that the equality of white men was founded on the slavery of blacks, and thus would be irrevocably lost if slavery were to be abolished. Thus, white supremacy for the South was not simply an isolated belief in the inherent superiority of whites as a race, it was the foundation for an aggressive and self-styled “progressive” worldview, a whole self-contained system of thought. The flag is inextricably linked to all of that.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAs a second starting point it’s also true that the Confederate battle flag was largely a relic until it was revived in response to the Civil Rights Movement — first with Strom Thurmond’s “States Rights Party” in 1948, then with Georgia adopting a version in protest of Brown v. Board of Education in 1956, and South Carolina six years later — though, tellingly, the flag went up a year before the act authorizing it. For almost a hundred years, the South got on just fine celebrating its heritage without benefit of the flag. Indeed, the flag was raised over South Carolina as a result of the Civil War centennial celebration. This revival of interest in the flag was clearly all about renewed defiance of the federal government, which was finally being prodded into making good on the Civil War Amendments, and ensuring the full citizenship of African-Americans. Hence, today, the “heritage” the flag actually stands for is that of the 1960s, not the 1860s. Good luck with that.\n\nA third, related point, made by Jeet Heer at the New Republic, is that the flag matters tremendously as exertion of raw power. Its reintroduction in response to the Civil Rights movement sent a clear message: “The feds might try to help you, but remember who is the boss down here. We still rule.” Flying everywhere throughout the South, it sends the constant message to black Southerners, that they are not safe, they are not in control of their own personal security, much less anything else. Whatever other stories Southern whites might tell themselves and others about the flag, this basic fact remains. Indeed, the rhetorical act of denying the flag’s white supremacist meaning only demonstrates further how completely whites control things.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBeyond these three starting points, there’s a vast terrain to explore, in terms of the white supremacist legacy the flag stands for and how it has reshaped itself over time. There are at least four key elements that any such account would have to explore. First, is the matter of white supremacy itself as a matter of organized social policy — both in terms of what it supports (slavery in one era, segregation in the next, etc.) and what it opposes (abolition, integration, “big government”) — as well as the culture it both depends upon and reproduces. Second, is the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to another, both establishing purportedly new foundations, while simultaneously reinterpreting the past.\n\nIt originally expressed itself in terms of slavery, then segregation and now largely in terms of what sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva described as “colorblind racism” in his book \"Racism Without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America.\" Third, is the way in which white supremacy naturalizes, normalizes and moralizes itself, so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify, much less name, and fight against. Bonilla-Silva’s book has a great deal to say about this as well. Furthermore, the pretense that the battle flag represents Civil War-era heritage rather than Civil Rights-era hatred is a telling example of how this process unfolds. Fourth, is the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals, such bringing people together, establishing peace and harmony, promoting tolerance, etc. Haley leaned very heavily on this aspect of white supremacy in the process of pretending to reject it. So let us briefly consider each of these in turn.\n\nFirst, let’s reflect on white supremacy as a matter of organized social policy. There is nothing particularly difficult for people today to look back on past forms of white supremacy and reject them. It’s easy nowadays to see slavery or segregation as evil. Even Rand Paul, defending segregation in principle, said it was a bad business decision. But what about white supremacy policies today?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhile part of the impetus to remove the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina came from respect for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the long-serving, highly respected member of the South Carolina State Senate, this only scratched the surface of Pinckney’s politics, as pointed out by North Carolina NAACP leader the Rev. William Barber on Democracy Now! recently:\n\nReverend Pinckney, as a colleague in ministry, was not just opposed to the flag, he was opposed to the denial of Medicaid expansion, where now the majority of the state is opposing Medicaid expansion where six out of 10 black people live. He was opposed to voter suppression, voter ID in South Carolina. He was opposed to those who have celebrated the ending of the Voting Rights Act, or the gutting of Section 4, which means South Carolina is no longer a preclearance state, and the very district that he served in is vulnerable right now. He was opposed to the lack of funding for public education. He wanted to see living wages raised.\n\nEvery item Barber mentioned is felt more deeply by the black community, so it’s not hard to grasp what a true rejection of white supremacy would look like. One might say that this calls for “activist government,” but the white South was all in favor of activist government \"When Affirmative Action Was White,\" as Ira Katznelson’s 2006 book explained. Thus, Barber continued:\n\nSo I would say to my colleagues, let’s take down the flag — to the governor — but also, let’s put together an omnibus bill in the name of the nine martyrs. And all of the things Reverend Pinckney was standing for, if we say we love him and his colleagues, let’s put all of those things in a one big omnibus bill and pass that and bring it to the funeral on Friday or Saturday, saying we will expand Medicaid to help not only black people, but poor white Southerners in South Carolina, because it’s not just the flag. Lee Atwater talked about the Southern strategy, where policy was used as a way to divide us. And if we want harmony, we have to talk about racism, not just in terms of symbol, but in the substance of policies. The flag went up to fight policies. If we’re going to bring it down, we’re also going to have to change policies, and particularly policies that create disparate impact on black, brown and poor white people.\n\nThe phrase “disparate impact,” which Barber used, is key to how white supremacy operates in the post-segregation era. It’s not that the races are treated entirely differently, only that the odds, burdens, privileges and benefits change, depending on the color of your skin. Often this happens without any conscious awareness, which is why Bonilla-Silva’s phrase, “racism without racists” is so apt. This is really not difficult to grasp — unless you’ve got a vested interest in not grasping it. In which case, welcome to the world of our second topic, the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to the next, and how\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTransitions between eras are often abrupt in some respects — the swift abolition of slavery in the final years of the Civil War, for example — while taking decades to work out in other ways. In order to first establish, and then fully stabilize the segregationist era, the meaning and purpose of the Civil War itself had to be reinterpreted through a white supremacist lens. The story of how that transpired over a fifty-year period is the subject of \"Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory\" by David W. Blight. As I summarized in my review:\n\nBlight explains three broad visions of Civil War memory - reconciliationist, emancipationist and white supremacist. The first was born in wartime responses to its terrible brutality, epitomized by Walt Whitman's experience of tending the wounded and dying of both sides. The second sprang not just from the war, but also from the Emancipation Proclamation and the more than 200,000 black combatants who joined the fight. The third gradually reformulated itself after the shock of military defeat, eventually dominating reconciliationist thinking by sacrificing racial reconciliation for the sake of sectional reunion.\n\nIt was not surprising that the reconciliationist view came to dominate — politically, materially, the nation needed sectional reintegration in a much more immediate way than it needed anything for its black citizens — a calculus that would eventually change over time. What’s striking is the relative ease with which the white supremacist vision came to merge with and dominate the reconciliationist view.\n\nThis is not the exception, but the rule in American history: any moves toward reconciling differences inevitably become infected with white supremacist aims — unless, of course, they are founded on them to begin with, as the case with American Colonization Society and the movement surrounding it, more on that below. A similar process has taken place with the end of segregation and the discrediting of overt racism which the norm in that era throughout the South, as well as in much of the North. This is essence of what Bonilla-Silva reveals in \"Racism Without Racists\": a set of beliefs has emerged with superficially broad appeal, but which harbors a “hidden” white supremacist impact. Bonilla-Silva identifies four central frames at the core of colorblind racism: \"The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information,\" Bonilla-Silva writes. The first — and what I take to be the most significant and distinctive frame — is “abstract liberalism,” which he explains as follows:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe frame of abstract liberalism involves using ideas associated with political liberalism (e.g. \"equal opportunity,\" the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy) and economic liberalism (e.g., choice, individualism) in an abstract manner to explain racial matters.\n\nWhat abstract liberalism hides is virtually everything having to do with history and indeed all social science, outside the narrow framework of market economics. It hides all historical inequalities, which recent research suggests persists for as long as ten generations. It also hides subconscious racial preferences, which can create intense segregation without any overt centralized coercion. But above all, it creates the illusion of some idealized social order, which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “reverse racism.” In short, the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them: they are the “real racists,” not whites!\n\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles, but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone. These are “naturalization,” which “allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences,” “cultural racism” which “relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education’ or ‘blacks have too many babies’ to explain the standing of minorities in society” and “minimization of racism” which “suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities' life chances (‘It's better now than in the past’ or ‘There is discrimination, but there are plenty of jobs out there’).” All three of these frames have been used in past eras. For example, Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past, so segregation was something blacks could and should accept. Similarly, cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism. But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today.\n\nAs I indicated above, not only does Bonilla-Silva’s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another, it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “naturalizes, normalizes and moralizes itself, so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify, much less name, and fight against.” Indeed, this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “common sense” emerges, responding to multiple different needs at once, most typically, a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible, and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible. The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude, even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact. Meanwhile, those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order, even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics.\n\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic, the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals, such bringing people together, establishing peace and harmony, promoting tolerance and so forth. It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else, and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done. Not only does white supremacy lay down the law, if conflicts arise in response, white supremacy takes the lead in naming, identifying and analyzing them, leading to proposed white supremacist solutions. On a macro scale, this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale, from the lowliest parts on up to the whole.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society.

         "Two wildly audacious films — Brady Corbet’s 215-minute postwar epic “The Brutalist” and Jacques Audiard’s Spanish language, genre-shifting trans musical “Emilia Perez” — won top honors at the 82nd Golden Globes on Sunday.\nThe Globes, which are still finding their footing after years of scandal and makeover, scattered awards around to a number of films. But the awards group put its strongest support behind a pair of movies that sought to be unlike anything else.\n“The Brutalist” was crowed best film, drama, putting one of 2024’s most ambitious films on course to be a major contender at the Academy Awards. The film, shot in VistaVision and released with an intermission, also won best director for Corbet and best actor for Adrien Brody.\n“I was told that this film was un-distributable,” said Corbet. “No one was asking for a three-and-half-hour film about a mid-century designer in 70mm. But it works.”\n“Emilia Pérez” won best film, comedy or musical, elevating the Oscar chances of Netflix’s top Oscar contender. It also won best supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña, best song (“El Mal”) and best non-English language film. Karla Sofía Gascón, the film’s transgender star who plays a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirming surgery, spoke for the film.\n“The light always wins over darkness,” said Gascón, gesturing to her brightly orange dress. “You can maybe put us in jail. You can beat us up. But you never can take away our soul or existence or identity.”\n“I am who I am. Not who you want.”\nThe night’s big actor winners included some surprises. One shocker was Moore’s win for best actress in a comedy or musical. Her comeback performance in “The Substance,” about a Hollywood star who resorts to an experimental process to regain her youth, landed the 62-year-old Moore her first Globe — a victory that came over the heavily favored Mikey Madison of “Anora.”\n“I’m just in shock right now. I’ve been doing this a long time, like over 45 years, and this is the first thing I’ve ever won as an actor,” said Moore, who was last nominated by the Globes for a film role in 1991 for “Ghost.” “Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress.”\nBest actress, in a drama film, was a surprise, too. The Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres won for her performance in “I’m Still Here,” a based-on-a-true-story drama about a family living through the disappearance of political dissident Rubens Paiva in 1970s Rio de Janeiro.\nBest supporting actor in a musical or comedy went to Sebastian Stan for another movie about physical transformation: “A Different Man,” in which Stan plays a man with a deformed face who’s healed. Stan, who was also nominated for playing Donald Trump in “The Apprentice,” noted that both films were hard to get made.\n“These are tough subject maters but these films are real and they’re necessary,” said Stan. “But we can’t be afraid and look away.”\nGlaser lightly roasts the Globes\nComedian Nikki Glaser kicked off the Globes, with a promise: “I’m not here to roast you.”\nBut Glaser, a stand-up whose breakthrough came in a withering roast of Tom Brady, made her way around the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on Sunday picking out plenty of targets in an opening monologue she had worked out extensively in comedy clubs beforehand.\nWhile Glaser might not have reached Tina Fey and Amy Poehler levels of laughs, the monologue was mostly a winner, and a dramatic improvement over last year’s host, Jo Koy. Last year’s Globes, following a diversity and ethics scandal that led to the dissolution of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, were widely panned, but delivered where it counted. Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS, who waded in after NBC dumped the Globes, signed up for five more years.\nHosting the Globes two weeks before the inauguration of Donald Trump, Glaser reserved perhaps her most cutting line for the whole room of Hollywood stars.\n“You could really do anything ... except tell the country who to vote for,” said Glaser. “But it’s OK, you’ll get ’em next time ... if there is one. I’m scared.”\nThe Globes are now owned by Todd Boehly’s Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, which acquired the award show from the now defunct Hollywood Foreign Press Association. After diversity and ethics scandals, the HFPA sold off the Globes and dissolved. However, more than a dozen former HFPA members are seeking to have the sale to Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions rescinded.\nA win for ‘Wicked’\nThe Globes' award for cinematic and box-office achievement went to Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked,” which has nearly collected $700 million in theaters. In a heavily arthouse Oscar field, “Wicked” is easily the biggest hit seen as having a chance to win best picture. Accepting the award, Chu argued for “a radical act of optimism” in art.\nThough few film awards have been predictable this season, Kieran Culkin is emerging has the clear favorite for best supporting actor. Culkin won Sunday for his performance in Jesse Eisenberg’s “A Real Pain,” his second Globe in the past year following a win for the HBO series “Succession.” He called the Globes “basically the best date night that my wife and I ever have,” and then thanked her for “putting up what you call my mania.”\nThe papal thriller “Conclave” took best screenplay, for Peter Straughan’s script. “Flow,” the wordless Latvian animated parable about a cat in a flooded world, took best animated film, winning over studio blockbusters like “Inside Out 2” and “The Wild Robot.” Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross won best score for their thumping music for “Challengers.”\nTV prizes\nMost of the TV winners were oft-awarded series, including the Emmy champ “Shōgun.” It won four awards, including best drama series and acting wins for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and Tadanobu Asano. Other repeat winners were: “Hacks” (best comedy series, actress for Jean Smart), “The Bear” (Jeremy Allen White for best actor) and “Baby Reindeer” (best limited series).\nAli Wong won for best stand-up performance, Jodie Foster for “True Detective” and Colin Farrell for his physical transformation in “The Penguin.”\n“I guess it’s prosthetics from here on out,” said Farrell.",

         "By Nimi Princewill, Joshua Replogle, Stephanie Halasz and Eve Brennan, CNN\n(CNN) — Residents of the besieged city of Goma, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, say they are gripped by fear as gunshots continue to ring out around their homes, days after rebel forces claimed they had taken over.\nSeveral people, including foreign peacekeepers, have reportedly died and hundreds more are injured as fighting persists for a third day between fighters of the AFC/M23 rebel coalition and government forces battling to reclaim the city.\nHospitals treating the wounded are overwhelmed, aid agencies said, who also reported grievous crimes committed against civilians.\nJens Laerke, a spokesperson for the United Nations humanitarian office said Tuesday that there are “many dead bodies” on the streets, adding that fighters have reportedly raped civilians.\nGoma resident Camilie, who did not want to give his full name for security reasons, told CNN he heard sounds of bombings and gunfire, and found bullet casings in his backyard.\n“People are hiding in their houses,” said Camille, who lives in Goma’s Himbi neighborhood. “People are scared because we have no electricity, water, or internet, so we spend the night in the dark.”\nHe added that several incidents of robberies and looting have also been witnessed in the area.\n“Yesterday, there was a little bit of calm, and people thought that everything was over. Some people went out in the streets and were able to buy some stuff. And during the situation, a lot of robbing and looting took place… Many warehouses and stores have been looted by the local population.”\nRams Kiriza, who lives in the center of Goma, heard detonations on Wednesday morning, but “for the moment, the situation is calm,” he said.\nKiriza said that the rebels were yet to capture parts of the city but had ordered locals to evacuate.\nThe rebel alliance – accused by Congolese authorities of being bolstered by Rwanda – told CNN earlier this week that they had captured the city. Home to around 2 million people, Goma is the provincial capital of North Kivu and the largest city in Congo’s east.\nHumanitarian and medical facilities have come under fire amid the fighting. Doctors Without Borders’ (MSF) emergency coordinator in North Kivu Virginie Napolitano said Wednesday that medical stocks had been looted and a bullet had pierced the roof of the operating theatre at the Kyeshero hospital as an operation was underway.\n“The impact of this fighting on the civilian population is enormous. In addition to the wounded and dead, we are receiving devastating reports from internally displaced people camps where our teams can no longer go,” MSF’s head of programs in North Kivu Stephan Goetghebuer said, according to Wednesday’s press release.\nThe fighting in Goma is also stirring panic in nearby cities. From Bukavu, Congolese citizen Benjamin Lindani told CNN, “Everyone is trying to rush to get some money out from their banks and get some food from supermarkets,” describing long lines of people at banks and markets.\nDavid Cikuru, who heads a civil society organization in Goma but recently moved out of the city to Bukavu, told CNN there were numerous government armed forces and pro-government militia fighters in Bukavu who had looted goods from some civilians. He said gunfire could also be heard on the outskirts of the city.\nRebels claim takeover\nOn Wednesday, Victor Tesongo, the AFC spokesman, told CNN: “The situation is very calm. We have taken control of the city despite some minor tensions from the government soldiers.”\nTesongo said that a stadium in Goma had been opened to receive surrendering government troops.\nOn Monday, the Uruguayan army, whose troops are part of the UN peacekeeping mission in Goma, said in a statement that “hundreds” of Congolese soldiers had laid down their weapons following M23’s 48-hour ultimatum.\nRwanda’s national broadcaster also shared footage of Congolese soldiers surrendering their arms to Rwandan forces at a Rwandan border post after fleeing Goma.\nThe Congolese government has not confirmed the rebels’ takeover but acknowledged their presence in Goma. Earlier on Wednesday, a new military governor was appointed for North Kivu, which was described by the Congolese military as being “under a state of siege.”\nThe army said that it remained “fully committed to restoring the authority of the State, neutralizing armed groups and ensuring the protection of the population.”\nOn Tuesday, the rebels gained control of Goma’s airport, blocking an ammunition shipment sent to the city by the Congolese army, a French intelligence source told CNN.\nThe violence also spiraled into the national capital, Kinshasa, where protesters lit fires outside several Western and African embassies, including that of Rwanda.\nCalls for ceasefire\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington was “deeply troubled” by the violence in eastern Congo, which borders Rwanda.\nDuring a call with Rwandan leader, Paul Kagame on Tuesday, Rubio urged warring parties to ensure “an immediate ceasefire” and “respect sovereign territorial integrity.”\nKagame described the conversation as “productive,” adding that it stressed “the need to ensure a ceasefire… and address the root causes of the conflict once and for all.”\nThe Congolese government accused Rwanda of equipping the M23 with both weapons and troops. Rwanda does not deny the allegations.\nA spokesperson for the Rwandan government, Yolande Makolo, told CNN that her country “will do what is necessary to defend our borders and protect Rwandans.”\nEastern African leaders plan to convene an emergency meeting this week to find solutions to the crisis, Kenya’s President William Ruto said Monday, urging Kagame and Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi “to heed the call for peace.”",

This hearing comes after President Biden and the Department of Justice warned that Americans face national security risks while TikTok is owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance. If the company doesn't agree to sell the app, TikTok could be banned in the U.S. as soon as Jan. 19. But, if that is the case, Matt Haverty, a comedian and University of Vermont alumni, said he'll lose more than just an app.\"What I really appreciate about TikTok and what it gave me was an audience that I can share work with,\" Haverty said. Haverty said he's been growing his TikTok platform since 2018 and has created a community over the last seven years. “I get to engage with people in a way that I didn’t before,\" he said. Meanwhile, there are still key issues that will need to be addressed during next week's court hearing, before a ban goes into effect, said Jared Carter, a professor at Vermont Law and Graduate School. The first is whether TikTok users are protected by the First Amendment, and, if so, whether banning the app would violate their rights. “The Supreme Court has this high level of what we call strict scrutiny analysis,\" Carter said. Carter said this is how the Supreme Court measures if a there is warranted need for restrictions such as a law banning TikTok. \"And does the law do it in such a way that it’s narrowly tailored to further that government interested? That’s a really high burden,\" Carter said. \"National security does tend to be one that the court takes, for reasonable purposes, seriously.\"So, next week, millions of eyes will be on the Supreme Court to see whether the justices decide to issue an injunction delaying a decision altogether or decide Tik Tok's fate. \"It's always hard, I've always said that I think TikTok, without a doubt, is the best social media platform,\" Haverty said. \"At the end of the day, I'm trying to be positive about it.\"\nIn one week, the U.S. Supreme Court will hold a two-hour hearing for both sides of the looming TikTok ban to present their case.\nThis hearing comes after President Biden and the Department of Justice warned that Americans face national security risks while TikTok is owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance.

However, little is known about the genetics of these first pioneers in Europe and the timing of the Neanderthal admixture with non-Africans.\nA key site in Europe is Zlatý kůň in Czechia, where a complete skull from a single individual who lived around 45,000 years ago was discovered and previously genetically analyzed. However, due to the lack of archaeological context, it was not possible to link this individual to any archaeologically defined group.\nA nearby site, the Ilsenhöhle in Ranis in Germany, about 230 km from Zlatý kůň, is known for a specific type of archaeology, the Lincombian-Ranisian-Jerzmanowician (LRJ), which dates to around 45,000 years ago. It has long been debated whether the LRJ culture was produced by Neanderthals or early modern humans.\nAlthough mostly small fragments of bones are preserved in Ranis, a previous study was able to analyze mitochondrial DNA from thirteen of these remains and found that they belonged to modern humans and not Neanderthals. However, since the mitochondrial sequence only constitutes a miniscule part of the genetic information, the relationships to other modern humans remained a mystery.\nLinking Zlatý kůň and Ranis\nA study published in Nature analyzed the nuclear genomes of the thirteen specimens from Ranis and found that they represented at least six individuals. The size of the bones indicated that two of these individuals were infants and, genetically, three were males and three were females.\nInterestingly, among these individuals were a mother and daughter, as well as other, more distant, biological relatives. The team also sequenced more DNA from the female skull found at Zlatý kůň, producing a high-quality genome for this individual.\n\"To our surprise, we discovered a fifth- or sixth-degree genetic relationship between Zlatý kůň and two individuals from Ranis,\" says Arev Sümer, lead author of the study. \"This means that Zlatý kůň was genetically part of the extended family of Ranis and likely also made LRJ-type tools.\"\nAmong the six individuals from Ranis, one bone was particularly well preserved. In fact, it is the best preserved modern human bone from the Pleistocene for DNA retrieval. This allowed the team to obtain a high-quality genome from this male individual, referred to as Ranis13.\nTogether, the Ranis13 and Zlatý kůň genomes represent the oldest high-quality modern human genomes sequenced to date. When analyzing genetic variants related to phenotypic traits, they found that Ranis and Zlatý kůň individuals carried variants associated with dark skin and hair color as well as brown eyes, reflecting the recent African origin of this early European population.\nBy analyzing the segments inherited from the same ancestor in the Ranis and Zlatý kůň genomes, the researchers estimate that their population consisted of at most a few hundred individuals who may have been spread out over a larger territory. The authors found no evidence that this small early modern human population contributed to later Europeans or any other world-wide population.\nA narrower timeframe for the shared Neanderthal admixture\nMembers of the Zlatý kůň/Ranis population coexisted with Neanderthals in Europe, raising the possibility that they may have had Neanderthals among their recent ancestors after they migrated to Europe. Previous studies on modern humans from over 40,000 years ago, had found evidence of such recent admixture events between modern humans and Neanderthals.\nHowever, no such evidence for recent Neanderthal admixture was detected in the genomes of the Zlatý kůň/Ranis individuals.\n\"The fact that modern human groups, which may have arrived in Europe later, carry such Neanderthal ancestry while Ranis and Zlatý kůň do not could mean that the older Zlatý kůň/Ranis lineage may have entered Europe by a different route or did not overlap as extensively with the regions where Neanderthals lived,\" speculates Kay Prüfer, who co-supervised the study.\nThe Zlatý kůň/Ranis population represents the earliest known divergence from the group of modern humans that migrated out of Africa and dispersed later across Eurasia. Despite this early separation, the Neanderthal ancestry in Zlatý kůň and Ranis originated from the same ancient admixture event that can be detected in all people outside Africa today.\nBy analyzing the length of the segments contributed by Neanderthals in the high-coverage Ranis13 genome and using direct radiocarbon dates on this individual, the researchers dated this shared Neanderthal admixture to between 45,000 and 49,000 years ago.\nSince all present-day non-African populations share this Neanderthal ancestry with Zlatý kůň and Ranis, this means that around 45,000 to 49,000 years ago, a coherent ancestral non-African population must still have existed.\n\"These results provide us with a deeper understanding of the earliest pioneers that settled in Europe,\" says Johannes Krause, senior author of the study.\n\"They also indicate that any modern human remains found outside Africa that are older than 50,000 years could not have been part of the common non-African population that interbred with Neanderthals and is now found across much of the world.\"",

         "One the first of assuming his duties in the White House, President Donald Trump signed a long list of executive orders. Among them was an order cthat sought to change the names of a few important landmarks.\nTitled “Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness,” the executive order mentioned the renaming of Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America. Google is complying with the change and says the updated name will soon reflect on Google Maps.\nRecommended Videos\nThe company says it follows a policy of changing the names of locations to match their description in official government datasets, referencing the Geographic Names Information Systems (GNIS) directory.\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\nWhen that happens, we will update Google Maps in the U.S. quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America.\n— News from Google (@NewsFromGoogle) January 27, 2025\n“When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the U.S. quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America,” the company wrote in an official post of X. The name change has not gone live for users in the US, as of press time.\nNotably, the updated name will only appear as Gulf of America to users on U.S. soil, or in regions under the state’s sovereign control. For the rest of the world, they will continue to see it labeled Gulf of Mexico in their map view.\nBack in 2009, Google published a policy explainer about naming scenarios where border disputes about overlapping territories and conflicting names arise. It says the company takes into account “guidance from authoritative references, local laws and local market expectations.”\nAs part of his executive order, Trump ordered the Secretary of Interior to update the GNIS, so that Mount Denali is scrubbed and Mount McKinley takes its place, a bid to honor President McKinley’s legacy.\nLikewise, all mention of Gulf of Mexico is to be expunged, and replaced with Gulf of America. “The naming of our national treasures, including breathtaking natural wonders and historic works of art, should honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans in our Nation’s rich past,” says the executive order.\nSuch a shift is not unheard of. On Google Maps, the Japanese users see “Sea of Japan” for the same water body that appears as “East Sea” for folks in South Korea.\nStandardization of geographical names is often a hot tussle and the debates often echo in the halls of the UN, no less.\nBack in 2015, Google scrubbed the name of “Zhongsha Islands” from a contested reef area and updated it to Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. The marine stretch is a cause of a geopolitical rift between China and the Philippines.\nFilipinos petitioned Google to scrub the Chinese name, arguing that it was akin to an illegal territorial grab by the Asian powerhouse.",

         "A man from Memphis, Tennessee has been found guilty by a judge in Fiji of murdering his wife during their honeymoon in 2022, the prosecutor’s office said Monday.Bradley Robert Dawson, 40, killed his wife, Christe Chen, who was 36, at the exclusive Turtle Island resort in the Yasawa archipelago two days after the newlyweds arrived in Fiji, then fled by kayak to a nearby island. Chen was discovered in the couple's room by resort staff with multiple blunt trauma wounds to her head after the couple was heard arguing and did not appear at breakfast or lunch the next day.Justice Riyaz Hamza found Dawson guilty in the Lautoka High Court last Thursday after a weeklong trial, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said. Dawson had defended the charge.The fact that Dawson was carrying his passport and other belongings with him when he was arrested indicated that he planned to flee, Hamza said, according to the Fiji Times newspaper. The judge said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Dawson and no one else had committed the offense.The U.S. national, who remains in custody in Fiji, faces a mandatory term of life in prison when he is sentenced in January. Fiji law permits a presiding judge to set a minimum term to be served before a pardon is considered.An attorney for Dawson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In 2022, a lawyer representing Christe Chen's parents said their daughter's body was so badly damaged that she could not be embalmed for return to the U.S. and her remains were cremated. Chen worked as a pastry chef before returning to school to become a pharmacist, and had worked in that capacity at a Kroger supermarket in Memphis.The family's lawyer, Ronald Gordon — who did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday — said Chen and Dawson were heard arguing over dinner the night before the murder.Dawson worked in the information technology department at Youth Villages, a nonprofit child welfare and support organization based in Memphis, the organization confirmed when he was arrested. An online records search showed no criminal arrests for Dawson in Shelby County, which includes Memphis.The Turtle Island resort, where the pair stayed, is an exclusive and remote 500-acre island that accommodates only 14 couples at a time.

         "WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump used a raucous rally Sunday on the eve of his inauguration to promise swift Day 1 action remaking the federal government, shifting federal priorities at breakneck speed and ensuring that “the curtain closes on four long years of American decline.”\nSupporters filled nearly all of the 20,000-plus-seat Capital One Arena in downtown Washington for a “Make America Great” victory celebration, and cheered as Trump said he’d take quick action on everything from cracking down on the U.S.-Mexico border to promoting oil drilling, reining in the federal workforce and eradicating diversity programs.\n“We’re going to give them the best first day, the biggest first week and the most extraordinary first 100 days of any presidency in American history,” said Trump, who also promised to roll back executive actions by his predecessor, outgoing President Joe Biden, “within hours.”\nIn an unusual move, Trump entered at the arena’s concourse level and deliberately made his way down the stairs before his speech, stopping frequently to pump his fist and pose for pictures with rallygoers. It was even more surreal after he finished speaking, when the Village People took the stage and the president-elect sang — and even briefly danced — along to “YMCA,” an unofficial anthem of his campaign.\nTrump said he’d jump start his agenda with a series of unilateral actions from the White House, telling the crowd, “You’re going to see executive orders that are going to make you extremely happy. Lots of them.”\n“Tomorrow we will not waste a single moment,” he vowed later to attendees at a dinner reception.\nSunday was Trump’s first full day back in Washington since his Election Day victory and gave him a chance to energize core supporters before the official pomp of Inauguration Day. Unlike when Trump helped spark a mob of his supporters to attack the Capitol and tried to retain power in 2021 after his loss to Biden, officials did not expect massive protests, unrest or violence.\nInstead, jubilant crowds reveled in Trump’s coming second term and MAGA’s total control of the Republican Party.\nYet even with a comfortable Electoral College victory and his party in full — albeit narrow — control of Congress, the incoming president is one of the most polarizing figures in U.S. history, with nearly as many fierce detractors as ardent supporters. That means it could be difficult for Trump to fulfill postelection pledges to promote bipartisanship while healing political differences.\nTrump has nonetheless insisted that unity will be a theme of his inauguration speech Monday, along with strength and fairness — despite spending months as a candidate saying that if elected he would seek retribution against political enemies.\nThat was the theme of much of his rally speech Sunday, when Trump returned to the greatest hits of his campaign — as if the race against Vice President Kamala Harris weren’t already long decided. Trump denounced “migrant crime” by evoking one of his favorite fictional characters, Hannibal Lecter, and promised to stamp out “woke” policies and oppose transgender rights.\n“Tomorrow, at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand new day of American strength and prosperity, dignity and pride,” Trump said, adding, “Once and for all, we’re going to end the reign of a failed and corrupt political establishment in Washington.”\nThe event also featured a performance by Kid Rock, who performed “All Summer Long” despite a cold mix of rain and snow falling outside. Others taking the stage included singer Lee Greenwood, whose “God Bless the USA” is a Trump favorite.\nBillionaire Tesla owner Elon Musk — who Trump has tasked with helping run a special commission to make the federal government more efficient — took the stage and said “we’re looking forward to making a lot of changes.” Jon Voight, an actor named by Trump as a special ambassador to Hollywood, declared the president-elect “our hero. A man who never gave up on the American people, and we the people never gave up on him.”\nStephen Miller, Trump’s pick to be deputy chief of staff and a key architect of the administration’s promised hard-line immigration polices, vowed that “justice is coming.”\n“We are about to get our country back and our democracy back,” Miller said, adding “Donald J. Trump is about to save this country.”\nWith frigid temperatures expected Monday, Trump directed most of Monday’s outdoor events to be moved indoors, and officials held a rehearsal Sunday for his swearing-in in the U.S. Capitol’s Rotunda, which holds only 600 people compared to the 250,000-plus guests who had tickets to view the inauguration from around the Capitol grounds.\nAlso Sunday, Trump had breakfast privately with Republican senators at Blair House, the president’s official guest residence, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, and took to his social media site to comment on the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the U.S. ban on TikTok.\n“Hostages starting to come out today!.” Trump wrote.\nOvernight, millions of U.S. users of TikTok lost the ability to watch videos on the social media platform as a federal ban on the app took effect. Though the site later began working again for some users, the disruptions reflected a new law requiring its China-based parent company, ByteDance, to divest for national security reasons.\nThe company made a personal appeal to Trump to intervene, posting a message saying, “We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.”\nTrump subsequently posted, “I’m asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark!” He promised to issue an executive order Monday “to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.” The president-elect also wrote that he was interested in the U.S. owning 50% of TikTok in a “joint venture” model, though he did not offer much detail on what that would look like.\nAnother stop for Trump on Sunday were snow-covered graves at Arlington National Cemetery, where he and Vice President-elect JD Vance — each wearing dark overcoats and red ties — walked together to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier for a wreath-laying ceremony that included the playing of taps. Trump mouthed “thank you” after placing the wreath.\nThe pair later spent nearly half an hour in Section 60, the burial site for military personnel killed while fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, talking with families of soldiers who died in the 2021 Kabul airport bombing.\nThe scene was far different than in August, when two Trump campaign staff members reportedly verbally “abused and pushed” aside a cemetery official who tried to stop them from filming and photographing in Section 60.",

         "By Brett Rowland | The Center Square\n(Worthy News) – President Donald Trump told world and business leaders Thursday to make products in America or prepare to pay tariffs.\nTrump’s remarks came the same day as a new analysis suggest his tariff plans could generate $1.5 trillion over the next decade. Tariffs are a tax paid on imports or exports.\nTrump plans to impose a 10% tariff on all imports from China and a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1.\nTrump spoke about his tariff plans Thursday by satellite to the 2025 meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He said that businesses that don’t make products in America will pay some kind of tariff.\n“My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth,” Trump said. “But if you don’t make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply, you will have to pay a tariff of differing amounts, but a tariff which will direct hundreds of billions of dollars – even trillions of dollars – into our Treasury to strengthen our economy and pay down debt.”\nIn an analysis, the Committee for a Responsible Budget assumed those would be minimum tariffs on goods currently facing less in tariffs. It estimated Trump’s tariff policies would boost revenue by about $140 billion over the rest of calendar year. If made permanent, CFRB estimated they would raise $1.5 trillion through fiscal year 2035 on a conventional basis – and accounting for economic effects, $1.3 trillion through 2035.\nThe group made its uncertainty about those estimates clear, noting that many outside factors could change projections.\n“Importantly, our estimates including dynamic and retaliatory effects on revenues are very rough and meant to convey the magnitude of their effects rather than precise scores,” the group noted in the analysis. “Based on available data from the Congressional Budget Office, we assume these tariffs would reduce U.S. output by about 0.3% once phased in. There is great uncertainty regarding the actual effects.”\nTrump has made big promises about his tariff plans. During his inauguration Monday, Trump said tariffs would make the U.S. “rich as hell.”\nJohn Paulson, founder of Paulson & Co. and a Trump campaign adviser, previously said Trump’s tariffs could generate $450 billion in revenue a year.\nHow much money tariffs would ultimately bring in depends on multiple factors, including how other nations respond. That makes it “highly uncertain,” according to credit-rating agency Moody’s.\n“While such measures could raise several trillion dollars in revenue over the next decade, they could also lead to revenue losses from potential retaliatory actions from other countries and other economic losses,” Moody’s noted in a recent report. “Therefore, the net effect on future revenues and fiscal deficits from such measures is highly uncertain.”\nTrump previously said he couldn’t guarantee that his tariff plans would not raise U.S. consumers’ prices.\nTariffs could raise prices for U.S. consumers and slow economic growth. S&P Global, a credit-rating agency, reported that Trump’s proposed tariffs could boost inflation by 1.8% and lower U.S. economic output by 1%, according to a post-election report.\nReprinted with permission from The Center Square.",

         "SAN FRANCISCO — OpenAI says its board of directors has unanimously rejected a $97.4 billion takeover bid by Elon Musk.\n“OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk’s latest attempt to disrupt his competition,” said a statement Friday from Bret Taylor, chair of OpenAI’s board.\nOpenAI attorney William Savitt in a letter to Musk’s attorney Friday said the proposal “is not in the best interests of OAI’s mission and is rejected.”\nMusk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker nearly a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit.\nOpenAI has increasingly sought to capitalize on the commercial success of generative AI. But the for-profit company is a subsidiary of a nonprofit entity that’s bound to a mission — which Musk helped set — to safely build better-than-human AI for humanity’s benefit. OpenAI is now seeking to more fully convert itself to a for-profit company, but would first have to buy out the nonprofit’s assets.\nThrowing a wrench in those plans, Musk and his own AI startup, xAI, and a group of investment firms announced a bid Monday to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI. Musk in a court filing Wednesday further detailed the proposal to acquire the nonprofit’s controlling stake.\nSavitt’s letter Friday said that court filing added “new material conditions to the proposal. As a result of that filing, it is now apparent that your clients' much-publicized ‘bid’ is in fact not a bid at all.” In any event, “even as first presented,” the board has unanimously rejected it, Savitt said.\nMusk has alleged in the lawsuit that OpenAI is violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. Musk had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.\nHe escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including OpenAI’s business partner Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would halt OpenAI’s for-profit conversion. Musk also added xAI as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was also unfairly stifling business competition. A judge is still considering Musk’s request but expressed skepticism about some of his claims in a court hearing last week.\n——\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.",

         "Advertisement\nLos Angeles wildfires: Families in shock begin to visit their charred homes in Los Angeles area\nMany watched their homes burn on television in a state of shock.Since the flames erupted in and around Los Angeles, scores of residents have returned to their still smoldering neighborhoods even as the threat of new fires persisted and the nation's second-largest city remained unsettled. For some, it was a first look at the staggering reality of what was lost as the region of 13 million people grapples with the gargantuan challenge of overcoming the disaster and rebuilding.What to know:The Kenneth and Eaton fires have resulted in over 12,000 structures being destroyed in Los Angeles.At least 11 people have died, prompting urgent evacuation orders across the affected areas.Gov. Gavin Newsom invited President-elect Donald Trump to tour the wildfire damage in Southern California.Climate change and dry winds are exacerbating the wildfire season, leading to unprecedented destruction.Calmer winds enabled firefighters to start gaining some control of the biggest blazes in metropolitan LA on Friday before gusty weather returns over the weekend to an area that hasn’t seen rain in more than eight months.Bridget Berg, who was at work when she saw on TV her house in Altadena erupt in flames, came back for the first time with her family two days later “just to make it real.”Their feet crunched across the broken bits of what had been their home for 16 years. Her kids sifted through debris on the sidewalk, finding a clay pot and a few keepsakes as they searched for Japanese wood prints they hoped to recover. Her husband pulled his hand out of rubble near the still-standing fireplace, holding up a piece of petrified wood handed down by his grandmother.“It’s OK. It’s OK,” Berg said as much to herself as others as she took stock of the destruction, remembering the deck and pool from which her family watched fireworks. “It’s not like we just lost our house — everybody lost their house.”Since the fires first began popping up around a densely populated, 25-mile expanse north of downtown LA, they have burned more than 12,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and vehicles. No cause has been identified yet for the largest fires.Allegations of leadership failures and political blame have begun and so have investigations. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 117 million-gallon reservoir was out of service and some hydrants ran dry, calling it “deeply troubling.” Meanwhile, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said city leadership failed her department by not providing enough money for firefighting. She also criticized the lack of water.“When a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there’s going to be water,” she said.Video above: Biden on California wildfiresAt least 11 people have been killed, with five from the Palisades Fire and six from the Eaton Fire, according to the LA County medical examiner's office. Officials said they expected that number to rise as cadaver dogs go through leveled neighborhoods to assess the devastation to an area larger than San Francisco.Officials on Friday set up a center where people could report those missing. Tens of thousands of people remained under evacuation orders, and the fires have consumed about 56 square miles (145 square kilometers).The disaster took homes from everyone — from waiters to movie stars. The government has not yet released figures on the cost of the damage, but private firms have estimated it will climb into the tens of billions. The Walt Disney Co. announced Friday it will donate $15 million to respond to the fires and help rebuild.The flames hit schools, churches, a synagogue, libraries, boutiques, bars, restaurants, banks and local landmarks like the Will Rogers’ Western Ranch House and a Queen Anne-style mansion in Altadena that dated back to 1887 and was commissioned for wealthy mapmaker Andrew McNally.Video above: Newsom invites Trump to tour fire damage in Southern CaliforniaNeighbors wandered around ruins Friday as they described now-vanished bedrooms, recently remodeled kitchens and outdoor living spaces.

And this is what’s left,” he said, pointing to the blackened rubble that was once his living room. “It’s those small family heirlooms that are the ones that really hurt the most.”Elsewhere in the city, people at collection sites picked through cardboard boxes of donated items to restart their lives.Firefighters made progress for the first time since Tuesday containing the Eaton Fire north of Pasadena, which has burned more than 7,000 structures. Officials said Friday most evacuation orders for the area were lifted.LA Mayor Karen Bass, who faces a critical test of her leadership as her city endures its greatest crisis in decades, said several smaller fires also were stopped.Crews were also gaining ground on the Palisades Fire, which burned 5,300 structures and is the most destructive in LA's history.California National Guard troops arrived on the streets of Altadena before dawn to help protect property in the fire evacuation zone, and evening curfews were in effect to prevent looting after several earlier arrests.The level of devastation is jarring even in a state that regularly confronts massive wildfires.Anna Yeager said she and her husband agonized over going back to their beloved Altadena neighborhood near Pasadena after fleeing with their 6-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son, their two dogs and some clothes.

         "In This Story\nA deadly plane crash Sunday killed nearly 179 people in South Korea, an enormous tragedy that led to a week-long period of mourning being declared in the country. As the victims and their families deal with the aftermath, a number of investigations have been launched to help figure out what happened.\nThe crash took place at at Muan International Airport, near the southern tip of the country, when a Boeing (BA+1.88%) 737-800 operated by South Korean l0w-cost carrier Jeju Air skidded across the runway before igniting in a giant fireball. The cause of the crash has yet to be determined, though Reuters reports that suspected factors include bad weather and a possible bird strike.\nAdvertisement\n“As of now, it is difficult to determine the cause of the accident, and we must wait for the official investigation announcement from the relevant government agencies,” CEO Kim Lee-Bae said in a public apology posted to the company’s website. “Regardless of the cause of the accident, I feel responsible as the CEO. Jeju Air will do everything it can to quickly recover from the accident and support the families of the passengers. We will also do our best to determine the cause of the accident together with the government.”\nAdvertisement\nThe Associated Press reports that the South Korean government, still sorting through the wreckage, has ordered the inspection of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the country. The model is an older one and not the same as the 737 Max 8 plane that suffered a pair of fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. Jeju Air reports its fleet being 42 planes-strong as of January 2024. According the plane-tracking website Planespotters.net, 36 of its 38 passenger planes are 737-800s.\nAdvertisement\n“The essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,” acting South Korean president Choi Sang-mok said, according to the Associated Press.\nAdditionally, the National Transportation Safety Board announced on X that it is leading a delegation of U.S. investigators to aid in the efforts to determine what caused the crash.\nAdvertisement\n“The NTSB is leading a team of U.S. investigators (NTSB, Boeing and FAA) to assist the Republic of Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) with their investigation,” the agency said.",

         "AP Aerospace Writer\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A pair of European satellites rocketed into orbit Thursday on the first mission to create artificial solar eclipses through fancy formation flying in space.\nEach fake eclipse should last six hours once operations begin next year. That’s considerably longer than the few minutes of totality offered by a natural eclipse here on Earth, allowing for prolonged study of the sun’s corona, or outer atmosphere.\nThe launch took place from India.\n“We are a very happy science team here” in India, the European Space Agency’s mission scientist Joe Zender said via email.\nBilled as a tech demo, the two satellites will separate in a month or so and fly 492 feet (150 meters) apart once reaching their destination high above Earth, lining up with the sun so that one spacecraft casts a shadow on the other.\nThis will require extreme precision, within just one millimeter, equivalent to a fingernail’s thickness, according to the European Space Agency. To maintain their position, the satellites will rely on GPS, star trackers, lasers and radio links, flying autonomously.\nEach cube-shaped spacecraft is less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) across. The shadow-casting satellite holds a disk to block the sun from the telescope on the other satellite. This disk will mimic the moon in a natural total solar eclipse, with the darkened satellite posing as Earth.\n“This has a huge scientific relevance” in addition to testing high-precision formation flying,” said the European Space Agency’s technology and engineering director Dietmar Pilz.\nScientists need the glaring face of the sun completely blocked in order to scrutinize the wispy crown-like corona encircling it, getting an especially good look close to the solar rim on this mission. They’re particularly interested to learn why the corona is hotter than the surface of the sun, and also want to better understand coronal mass ejections, eruptions of billions of tons of plasma with magnetic fields out into space.\nThe resulting geomagnetic storms can disrupt power and communication on Earth and in orbit. Such outbursts can also produce stunning auroras in unexpected places.\nWith a lopsided orbit stretching from 370 miles (600 kilometers) to 37,000 miles (60,000 kilometers) away, the satellites will take nearly 20 hours to circle the world. Six of those hours — at the farther end of certain orbits — will be spent generating an eclipse. Other orbits will be strictly for formation flying experiments, according to the European Space Agency.\nThe first eclipse results should be available in March, following checkout of both craft.\nZender said eclipses will be created at least twice a week, with six hours of totality each time for corona observations. The frequency will depend on solar activity, he noted, and prove a boon for scientists who now must travel across the world for a mere three to five minutes of totality during the occasional eclipse.\nThe $210 million mission, dubbed Proba-3, is aiming for at least 1,000 hours of “on demand” totality during its two-year operation. Once their job is done, both satellites will gradually drop lower until they burn up in the atmosphere, likely within five years.\nLiftoff was delayed a day by a last-minute issue with the backup propulsion system of one of the satellites, crucial for precision formation flying. The European Space Agency said engineers relied on a computer software fix.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

         "The signs that something unusual was afoot in Maspeth, Queens, on Thursday morning could be seen even before reaching the hulking structure that is DBK4, Amazon’s delivery stations, where drivers load up their vans with packages for the New York metro area. As the sun rose over the industrial area, workers could be seen streaming toward the facility’s entrance, identifiable in blue Amazon-branded apparel and black-and-gold International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) bomber jackets, signs reading “Amazon is unfair” in hand.\nAt 6 a.m., the workers formed a picket line outside the warehouse, slowing the flow of goods out of DBK4, chanting and dancing and holding signs reading “Amazon is unfair.” It is one of seven active picket lines at Amazon facilities across the country: DGT8 in Atlanta, Georgia; DFX4, DAX5, and DAX8 in Southern California; DCK6 in San Francisco; and DIL7 in Skokie, Illinois are the others. At all of these locations, Amazon workers have unionized with the Teamsters.\nThe company has refused to bargain with the union, so the 1.3-million-strong IBT set a deadline: agree to bargain by December 15 or face an unfair labor practice (ULP) strike. When that date passed without movement on the company’s side, the Teamsters followed through on their promise. Additional Teamsters-affiliated Amazon workers — most notably those at the gigantic JFK8 fulfillment center on Staten Island, which was the first Amazon warehouse in the United States to unionize as the Amazon Labor Union and whose workers have since voted to affiliate with the IBT — are expected to join the strike in the coming days. JFK8 in particular is set to join the strike at midnight.\nThe striking facilities represent a tiny fraction of the hundreds of Amazon facilities dotting the country, but worker organizing must start somewhere. The smaller, more centrally located delivery stations are strategic targets for a movement that ultimately will need to organize many more Amazon facilities to overcome the company’s ability to reroute packages away from warehouses where workers are engaged in collective action.\nAmazon has reshaped the United States, not only economically but socially, culturally, and politically. Some of those changes have followed from trapping millions of Americans — not only their own workers — in the bottom rungs of the labor market. It’s hard to organize a company that operates on such a scale, but recent years have seen walkouts and union drives and work stoppages at Amazon, all of which are kindling in the fire now raging in the hearts of some of the company’s workers, including those who are now on strike. This week’s escalation will no doubt serve as similar inspiration for other Amazon workers who are watching, weighing the viability of the union movement as a means of improving the conditions of the place where they spend much of their waking lives.\nDisputed Status\nAmazon has said that it views the current strike as “illegal.” The issue turns upon a disagreement over the status of its hundreds of thousands of drivers. These workers are currently employed by delivery service partners (DSPs), small companies that operate as contractors for Amazon. Many exist solely to service the company. Workers argue that this is misclassification and that Amazon should be considered their joint employer alongside the DSPs, and that Amazon thus has the duty to bargain with them. Many of these drivers wear Amazon-branded clothing, drive Amazon-branded vans, and have their schedules, their appearance, and their pay ultimately determined by Amazon. Bargaining with a DSP that simply answers to Amazon would be fruitless.\nAmazon has been fighting this argument in the courts, hoping to avoid joint-employer status. Thus far, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has shown signs of siding with the drivers, tending to rule that large companies like Amazon have an obligation to bargain with employees of contractor firms over which they exert control. Yet with conservatives set to gain majority control of the board when Donald Trump takes office, workers aren’t waiting for the courts. As the old labor movement adage goes, you win a union by acting like one.\nIt’s worth noting too that Amazon hasn’t agreed to bargain with the workers at JFK8 either, even though their status as direct employees is not in dispute. Those workers unionized on May 1, 2022, yet the company has refused to recognize their union, much less negotiate with it. Regardless of legal status, Amazon is defending its right to pursue sky-high profits without limitation, regulation, or rule of law; it certainly isn’t interested in giving workers a say in the matter.\nFor members of the DBK4 union, Amazon’s refusal to bargain with them is yet another example of its disrespect for the workers who power its operations. As several DBK4 drivers pointed out to me, many workers on the picket lines wore Amazon windbreakers rather than the company’s warmer winter coats; that’s because the company didn’t issue winter coats this year.\n“It’s penny pinching,” explained Lamont Hopewell, who has worked at one of DBK4’s eight DSPs for eight months. “They say they’re out of stock, but by the time they’re in stock, it’s summer.”\nUnions are not new to Hopewell. He previously worked as a United Parcel Service (UPS) driver, where he saw the union difference when it came to pay and benefits. The roughly 340,000 Teamsters who work at UPS enjoy far higher wages than their counterparts at Amazon, and not only good benefits but more rights on the job in matters of safety and security. At Amazon, Hopewell said he does similar work but with none of the security.\nThose concerns were echoed by other DBK4 union members. Latrice Johnson, who has worked out of DBK4 for a year, listed not only poor pay and benefits at the top of her priorities, but also safety as a concern, recounting being given a broken hand truck to assist her on her route. It’s no surprise at a company whose injury rate is double that of comparable operations, with even higher rates during the current peak season.\n“They say safety is the number-one priority, but that’s not true,” Johnson said.\nOn the DBK4 picket line yesterday, the only threat to workers’ safety came from the NYPD. Dozens of officers pushed workers, journalists, and elected officials alike to clear the exits, using their bodies (in an undeniably goofy fashion) and threats of arrest to clear space for vans to exit the warehouse, using barricades to break what had been a strong picket line by around 11 a.m. In the process, they arrested Teamsters Local 804 organizer Antonio Rosario, a leader during the 1997 UPS strike.\nMany of DBK4’s drivers have yet to join the union and, as at the other striking locations, reported to work as usual despite the strike. When a van approached the picket, strikers would speak with the driver, asking them to, as the chant went, “put it in park.”\nWhen Jogernsyn Cardenas, a DBK4 driver, decided to do precisely that, the police first tried to force him to get back in the van. When he refused, they arrested him too. A minor melee ensued, with workers demanding the police let him go, while the officers pushed their way out of the crowd.\nIt was a brazen display of the police doing the bidding of an employer, breaking the law themselves by violating workers’ First Amendment rights. Perhaps the NYPD should be considered a third-party contractor for Amazon as well.\nUpon their release, both Rosario and Cardenas returned to the picket line, receiving raucous welcomes from fellow picketers. As Cardenas told labor journalist Luis Feliz Leon of his decision to join the strike, ​“I feel like a hero because I had the courage to stop my van.”\nAs for Jeff Bezos, the oligarch at the center of these workers’ woes, several picketers noted that their boss had spent the prior evening dining with fellow billionaires Donald Trump and Elon Musk at Mar-a-Lago. Bezos had been quick to congratulate Trump on his election night victory and no doubt looks forward to the lower tax rate the incoming president has promised his confreres.\nFar from Trump’s estate, under the clear blue sky outside of DBK4, I asked Hopewell what he would say to Bezos. He brought up the holidays.\n“I’d ask him to think about his own family,” he said. “Wouldn’t you want your child to have Christmas off work with pay? Wouldn’t you want your mother or sister or brother to have health insurance?”\nWhen I later put the question to Johnson, she grinned.\n“Oh, we’ve got a lot to talk about,” she said. “Jeff Bezos, I have a lot of things I can put you onto to make you a better person. All these people making this money for you? Respect us.”",

         "https://www.wsws.org/asset/013e872a-4f18-47f0-a20b-489a4c3610a7?rendition=1600x900",
         "The Communication Workers Union (CWU) spent last week smoothing the path for the UK Labour government’s approving the £3.5 billion takeover of Royal Mail by billionaire Daniel Kretinsky and his private equity firm EP Group.\nThe union bureaucracy blazed the trail for this by colluding in dismantling the mail service under the guise of Universal Service Obligation (USO) “reform.”\nUnder their “engagement” policy with the takeover dating back to June, CWU General Secretary Dave Ward and Deputy General Secretary Postal Martin Walsh held private talks with EP Group and the Sir Keir Starmer’s government. Last Wednesday, a National Briefing was organised by the CWU Postal Executive on the takeover and USO—with attendance restricted to “senior (union) representatives”—at the Trades Union Congress headquarters, who also met the following day about restructuring the CWU.\nThe CWU produced a video broadcast Friday evening, with just one hours’ notice to members provided on the union Facebook page. The “CWU Live” event was a pre-packaged half-hour recording, with CWU officials assembled at Congress House. Its aim was to endorse the takeover, while issuing empty pledges about protecting the workforce to browbeat opposition among postal workers.\nThe tone was set by Ward, who spoke of “constructive” talks with EP Group and asserted that the takeover would be a “fresh start”, a “reset on employee industrial relations” and lead to a new model of governance providing workers with “a serious stake” in the business.\nThe same pro-business jargon was employed in the service of the sellout deal co-authored by the CWU postal executive with Royal Mail to break the resistance of postal workers after 18 days of strike action and end their year-long national dispute last July. The corporatist Business Recovery, Transformation & Growth agreement has resulted in the biggest attack on postal workers in their history with a bonfire of terms and conditions, the destruction of thousands of jobs and imposition of a two-tier workforce with new entrants on inferior pay and terms.\nThe bid documents produced by Kretinsky cites the benefits to investors of reduced labour costs and increased flexibility delivered by the union.\nWard told CWU members “We cannot be one of those organisations with some romantic notions of how it used to be”, as he demanded Royal Mail “grow its revenues” by “offering products and services customers want”—insisting this meant parcel deliveries on weekends and also afternoons and evenings for frontline delivery staff. This message could have been delivered by chief executive of Royal Mail-IDS Martin Seidenberg or representatives of EP Group.\nWard then de facto endorsed ditching the USO by citing figures that it only accounted for 14 percent of the mail service, echoing the pro-business line that it is a drain on profits. This is the scandal for Ward—not Royal Mail once again being found this week to have breached legal targets to deliver a six-day letter service to 32 million addresses across the UK, receiving a £10.5 million slap wrist fine by regulator Ofcom.\nWard continued to foreground company talking points that Royal Mail’s conversion into a parcel carrier along the lines of Amazon was the inevitable outcome of the decline in letters in a digital age. He never addressed how Royal Mail last met its combined targets for First- and Second-class delivery seven years ago, despite the decline in mail volume.\nWard speaks on behalf of the right-wing, pro-business Labour government and its partners in the trade union bureaucracy. He admitted the Labour government was likely to agree the Kretinsky takeover, entirely in keeping with Starmer’s pledge to tear up regulations and oversee “shock and awe” on behalf super-rich investors.\nThe CWU leader insisted on the need to collaborate with Royal Mail against its rivals in the parcel courier sector: “Their model of employment, as our members know, is predominantly self-employed and bogus self-employed. You don’t have any of the add ons like pensions, holiday pay, any sick pay—all of that stuff. And that model undercuts Royal Mail and as much as we don’t like what Royal Mail do, if we do not have that context in mind then we’re being irresponsible.”\nThe “add ons” and “all of that stuff” are the rights won by previous generations of workers in struggle, which Ward intends to sacrifice on the altar of corporate profit. Such a corporatist and nationalist agenda is directed against the class unity of Royal Mail workers with their fellow workers at Amazon, Evri and DPD. In opposition to this divide-and-rule offensive, workers must wage a collective struggle against the entire global corporate elite.\nCWU officials have worked to dismantle the USO in preparation for the Kretinsky takeover. Martin Walsh claimed the union was proceeding with caution over proposals announced in April by Royal Mail to slash letter delivery to alternate weekdays for all mail other than First Class. But the CWU agreed to pilot the “Optimised Delivery Model”, now agreed for 37 delivery offices across the country, prior to formal approval by the regulator next summer. The cost-cutting proposals will generate £300 million a year, which will now be diverted into private equity profit.\nWalsh stated that the union was trying to “leverage the USO” to get the right deal with Kretinsky, claiming that gutting the mail service could facilitate an increase in Saturdays off for delivery workers, part-time workers becoming full-time and an improvement in the terms and pay of new entrants the CWU agreed to as part of its rotten deal with Royal Mail.\nThe reality of the downsizing operation is forecasted job losses of 7,000, as Walsh confirmed at an earlier CWU Live online meeting in response to questions from postal workers.\nWard and Walsh forfeited any right to speak for postal workers with their miserable betrayal last July and their implementation of a record number of revisions as part of a cost-cutting exercise to remove duties and increase workloads.\nThe Postal Workers Rank-and-File Committee (PWRFC) calls for the fight against the CWU leadership to be escalated in response to their collusion with the EP Group takeover. It takes place under conditions in which postal workers internationally are being driven into struggle against similar attacks, including postal services being primed for privatisation in Canada, the US and Australia. Labour-saving automation and AI technology which could be used to rationally plan and make work easier, and provide secure well-paid jobs, have been weaponised to slash thousands of jobs, reduce labour costs and expand gig economy working practices.\nThrough the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees, the PWRFC and its international counterparts are seeking to unify these struggles and break the stranglehold of union bureaucracies who function as an arm of management, the corporations and governments.\nThe more than a month long strike by 55,000 Canada Post workers over a new collective bargaining agreement has become a major confrontation with the Crown Corporation and its restructuring agenda. The Trudeau Liberal government has taken steps to illegalise the strike and enforce a return-to-work, as it did recently against rail and dock workers. In opposition to this, the Postal Workers Rank-and-File Committee at Canada Post has advanced a strategy for postal workers to take control of their fight out of the hands of the bureaucracy and spearhead a working-class counteroffensive against the dictatorial methods of rule used to enforce austerity and war.\nWe encourage Royal Mail workers to make common cause with Canada Post workers as they face the same fight here in the UK against Kretinsky and his allies in the CWU and the Labour government. Royal Mail workers looking to conduct such a struggle should contact the PWRFC and participate in drawing up a strategy for a counteroffensive.",

         "A few things have happened since we last left Pete Hegseth sitting at the end of the bar and kind of nodded to the bartender like “Sorry, he was never our problem to begin with.”\nYesterday, we noted that Newsmax host Greg Kelly has turned on Hegseth’s nomination to be the secretary of Defense, and wondered if other worms were in the process of turning. (You know, like the dead worm in fellow batshit Trump nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s brain, if that worm still had life and the ability to turn instead of being dead inside RFK’s body.)\nWe were skeptical, because right-wing morons like Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis were giving Hegseth the old “Aw shucks! Boys’ll be boys, I reckon!” treatment. Specifically, she called him a “wild child.” We guess “wild child” is the traditional white conservative reaction to rape accusations.\nBut now listen to Lummis:\n“These allegations that have come up just in the last 12 to 14 hours are a surprise to all of us, and so, yes, he does need to address those, because this was not something of which we were aware, nor was President Trump aware of them.”\nUh oh, Pete Hegseth, you in danger, girl.\nIndeed, the worms seem to be turning quite rapidly on the Hegseth nomination, and it’s entirely possible that by the end of the week we’ll have an entirely new unqualified clownfuck of a nominee, like Ron DeSantis. (No really.)\nYou know, unless Pete’s mommy was able to fix it with her Fox News interview this morning, where she said she didn’t mean all those extremely detailed things she said about Pete being an “abuser of women” and whatnot.\nMaybe she was just hangry that day.\nNBC News had a one-two punch late in the afternoon yesterday. One followed on Jane Mayer’s reporting in The New Yorker about Hegseth’s long history of perpetual drunkassitude and mistreatment of women. Now 10 current and former Fox News people were whispering at NBC News saying oh yeah, we smelled alcohol on him before he went on the air, more than a dozen times and as recently as a month ago. Some sources felt like they had to “babysit” him. They had to call him to wake him up, due to his late-night drinking lifestyle. He would show up 20 minutes before air. Reminder: Hegseth worked on “Fox & Friends Weekend,” which goes on at 6:00 a.m.\nNBC News notes that this brings up questions about Hegseth’s ability to be SecDef specifically, because it’s a round-the-clock job involving crisis-level decisions that come up at all hours around the globe.\n“For the sake of national security, I really hope he has stopped drinking,” one of the former Fox employees said.\n“He should not be secretary of defense,” another former Fox employee said. “His drinking should be disqualifying.”\nThe other NBC News bombshell said as many as six Republican senators, or perhaps at least six Republican senators, are having extreme qualms about supporting Hegseth’s nomination.\nRemember when we said you in danger, girl, like five seconds ago? Well listen to Joni Ernst, who is on the Armed Services Committee:\n[Ernst] would not commit to supporting Hegseth's nomination and said she planned to grill the former cable news host about news accounts of his alleged alcohol abuse, mistreatment of woman and financial mismanagement.\n“We’re just going to have a really frank and thorough conversation,” Ernst said of Hegseth’s nomination process.\nDoes that sound Midwest Nice for “yr fucked” to y’all? Because it sounds like that to us.\nRoger Wicker of Mississippi, also on the Armed Services Committee: “I think there are questions that some members have and we’re going to be looking for an answer,” said Wicker.\nEven Lindsey Graham is starting to sound waffly, and that guy will walk uphill both ways in the snow to give Donald Trump his daily tongue-bath.\nLots more “ehhhhhhhhh” quotes from Republican senators here.\nSo If Not THAT Garbage White Man, Then …\nWell, what about Ron DeSantis!\nThink about it:\nRon DeSantis: Woke Police!\nPete Hegseth: Drunk Woke Police!\n(Donald Trump thinks being the Woke Police is the most important thing for the military, because Donald Trump is a monumentally stupid pigfuck person.)\nRon DeSantis: All those unconfirmed rumors about him at least watching torture at Guantanamo and liking it when he was a JAG lawyer!\nPete Hegseth: Got Trump to pardon literal murderer war crimers! Was he drunk at the time? Who knows!\nOur point is that literally any human Donald Trump picks for the role is going to be literal actual human garbage.\nThe Wall Street Journal broke the story late last night that Trump was in talks with DeSantis to replace Hegseth. Or maybe he might pick Joni Ernst. Some Trumpers have mentioned that other Tennessee moron senator idiot Bill Hagerty. Or maybe he might pick this other guy, Eldridge Colby, who JD Vance loves.\nWill he pick DeSantis, even though half of Trumpworld hates him? Will he wrangle an Art of the Deal to get DeSantis to appoint Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, to be Marco Rubio’s interim replacement in the Senate? (Marc Caputo at the Bulwark discusses how that is now part of this.) Who knows! The possibilities are endless, and endlessly stupid.\nAll the articles are saying some form of the same thing about how today and tomorrow are critical for Hegseth’s nomination. He’s on the Hill meeting with senators again.\nWill he charm them by pulling a flask from behind their ears like a shiny quarter? We don’t know!\nWill Mommy’s Fox News interview save him? Ha ha, it would be so fucking MAGA alpha male if it did.\nEvery one of these abusers with Little Man Syndrome is also some MAGA Mommy’s precious little boy, it seems! (By the way, if you can stomach the whining, Hegseth is just out with a Wall Street Journal op-ed.)\nWhatever happens, the end of this story will be bad for America and for its military. That’s the only thing we can guarantee.\n[NBC News / NBC 4 Los Angeles / Wall Street Journal / Politico Playbook]\nEvan has a side project called The Moral High Ground, you should check it out and subscribe there too!\nFollow Evan Hurst on BlueSky!\nFollow Evan on Facebook.\nHere, a LinkTree!\nShare",

         "On Sunday, New York City police released two new photos of the man believed to have shot and killed Brian Thompson, chief executive officer of UnitedHealthcare, early Wednesday morning as he walked to an investor conference at the Hilton Midtown Hotel.\nThe images apparently show the unidentified gunman in the back seat of a taxi in Manhattan on his way out of the city approximately 15 minutes after he shot Thompson. The New York City Police Department said the suspect took a cab uptown to a bus terminal near the George Washington Bridge, “where he may have caught a bus out of the state.”\nThe manhunt for the shooter, the subject of nonstop coverage on US news networks for the past five days, is one aspect of the response of the ruling establishment to the murder of Thompson, the highly compensated 50-year-old CEO of the spectacularly profitable health insurance giant worth a reported $560 billion.\nThe near-constant reportage of the investigation and search for the shooter has proceeded alongside recognition by the corporate media of the public reaction to the shooting, which has expressed little sympathy for Thompson. Much of it, on social media in particular, has been scathing of UnitedHealthcare and the healthcare insurance industry in general.\nThe Hill, for example, wrote on Friday:\nSome people began posting testimonials about their experiences with UnitedHealthcare and how badly they felt they had been mistreated. There were stories of losing loved ones because they were denied a claim, families suffering financial strain or ruin and people whose pain and suffering were drawn out not by the affliction or disease they had, but by the insurance company from which they were supposed to be getting service.\nThe Hill report continued:\nMany people seem to think that Brian Thompson deserved to die. On social media, these have been celebrating the death of the victim and proclaiming the alleged killer as a “hero.” Some have dubbed the unnamed suspect “Robin Hoodie,” among other aliases.\nWhile the specific motive behind the murder of Thompson remains unknown, it must be stated that there is nothing progressive in the gunning down of Thompson. The apparent connection between the shooting and the claims policies of UnitedHealthcare—as indicated by the handwritten words “delay” and “deny” on shell casings found at the scene—do not in any way point in the direction of a solution to problems facing millions of people that are rooted in the profit system.\nIf anything, acts of individual violence against individual representatives of the corporate and financial elite provide the ruling class with the opportunity to carry out attacks on the basic democratic rights of the working class and strengthen the repressive apparatus of the state against the mass struggles required to put an end to capitalism.\nIn the aftermath of the shooting and public response to it, the corporate media has suddenly discovered that UnitedHealthcare is notorious for denying health insurance claims and mistreating the insured. According to a column by Robin Abcarian in the Los Angeles Times, the popular response illustrates “the hatred so many Americans feel toward for-profit health insurance companies, which too often make money for stockholders by withholding care from sick people.”\nAt the same time, the mouthpieces for the financial interests behind the healthcare and health insurance industries have reacted with fear to both the shooting and the public’s response to it.\nAn Editorial Board statement published on Saturday by the Washington Post—owned by the second wealthiest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, with a net worth of $246 billion—had the headline, “A sickness in the wake of a health insurance CEO’s slaying: There is no excuse for the killing of Brian Thompson or celebrating his death.”\nThe statement justified the profits made by the insurance industry and said, “Of necessity, corporate chieftains are already reacting by fortifying their personal security, in case the shooting inspires copycat violence. Other insurers are deleting images of their leaders or removing webpages that list their executives.”\nThe New York Post, which is part of the media empire owned by Rupert Murdoch, who has a net worth of $22 billion, published an opinion piece by Nicole Gelinas that said:\nThere’s another reason why the Thompson killing is a bad sign for New York: The open-air execution of a top executive has spurred the finance and business world to beef up security. ... If the level of security you need dictates that you never enter a crowded, or even uncrowded, space with any strangers—that you literally cannot cross the street from one hotel sidewalk to another without risking your life—then New York is not the place for you.\nAn op-ed in the New York Times by Zeynep Tufekci pointed to “the fraying of the social contract” and complained that “Americans express less and less trust in many institutions.” It continued:\nCorporate executives are already reportedly beefing up their security. I expect more of them to move to gated communities, entrenched beyond even higher walls, protected by people with even bigger guns.\nThe New York Post also reported that Allied Universal, a private security firm that provides security services to 80 percent of Fortune 500 companies, has had its phones “ringing off the hook” since the murder of Thompson on Wednesday. The Post report said a full-time security contract for a chief executive costs approximately $250,000.\nThe Post report continued:\nThe vast increase in calls to the firm comes as dozens of Fortune 1000 chiefs will descend on Manhattan to attend a summit at Midtown’s Ziegfeld on 54th Street, not far from where Thompson was gunned down by a masked gunman outside the Hilton hotel.\nWhile the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has produced nonstop coverage on the cable news and corporate media outlets, devoted largely to the manhunt for his killer, the brutal murder of a migrant teen in New York City a day later has been barely reported. The apparent hate crime, in which 17-year-old Yeremi Colino was stabbed in the chest with a screw-driver after he replied “No” when asked if he spoke English, has elicited no police dragnet or manhunt for the suspect.",

         "Scott Morgenstern, University of Pittsburgh\nDonald Trump has made clear his intent to supercharge his “America First” approach to foreign policy in his second term – and Mexico looks set to be at the tip of the spear.\nWhile many of Trump’s predecessors have also followed a “realist” strategy – that is, one where relative power is at the forefront of international relations, while diplomatic success is viewed through how it benefits one’s own nation – the incoming president has displayed an apparent unwillingness to consider the pain that his plans would inflict on targeted countries or the responses this will engender.\nTrump’s proposed policies threaten Mexico in three key ways: First, his goal of deporting millions of migrants would put tremendous pressure on Mexico’s economy and society as the country tried to absorb the influx. This would be exacerbated by his second threat, a sharp increase in tariffs, which could devastate the critical export sector of Mexico’s economy. And third, Trump has floated the idea of using U.S. military power to confront narcotraffickers within Mexico, which would directly impinge on Mexico’s sovereignty and could generate more violence on both sides of the border.\nBut as a scholar of Latin American politics and U.S.-Latin American relations, I see several options that Mexico could use to push back on Trump by imposing high costs on U.S. interests.\nIndeed, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has already signaled how she may counter Trump’s policies. The most obvious tools are ending cooperation on drugs and immigration and imposing tariffs of her own. She could also revoke some of the decades-old tax and labor privileges that have benefited U.S. businesses operating within Mexico. And finally, she could play the “China card” – that is, in the face of worsening U.S.-Mexico ties, Mexico could turn to Washington’s biggest economic rival at a time when Beijing is seeking to assert more influence across Latin America.\nFrom conciliation to confrontration\nOf course, a worsening relationship is not inevitable.\nDuring Trump’s first term, Mexico’s then-president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, maintained a constructive relationship with the U.S. administration. In fact, Lopez Obrador was surprisingly cooperative given Trump’s at times hostile rhetoric toward Mexico. For example, he helped facilitate the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” program for those seeking asylum in the U.S. and also accepted Trump’s demands to renegotiate NAFTA and give it a title reflecting U.S. leadership: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.\nSheinbaum, who took office on Oct. 1, 2024, started with a cautious approach to her relationship with Trump.\nShe congratulated Trump on his victory and urged dialogue with the incoming U.S. president. “There will be good relations with the United States. I’m convinced of that,” she told reporters on Nov. 7, 2024.\nBut Trump hasn’t been conciliatory. In addition to talk about dumping millions of immigrants across the border, he announced on social media on Nov. 24 that he would impose a 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods – a move that would effectively abrogate the USMCA.\nThat post seemingly ended Sheinbaum’s cautious approach. In a strongly worded response, the Mexican president cautioned that she would respond in kind. A trade war, she noted, would harm the economies of both countries; progress on immigration and drug trafficking required cooperation, not threats, she added.\nThe impact of tariffs\nSheinbaum has said she wants to avoid a trade war, but Trump’s threats have led her nonetheless to talk about how a trade war would begin. This trade war, plus other costs Sheinbaum could impose on U.S. investors, would also likely foment a coalition of opposition within the U.S. business community – a group that has been a key ally of Trump.\nTrump’s stated goal of putting high tariffs on goods coming from Mexico is to encourage businesses that currently exploit lower employment costs in Mexico to relocate to the northern side of the border. But that approach ignores the impact that retaliatory tariffs and investment controls would have on U.S.-based companies that rely on the Mexican market. It would have several negative effects.\nFirst, a tit-for-tat tariff war would generate inflation for U.S. and Mexican consumers.\nSecond, it would disrupt the integration of markets across North America. As a result of the elimination of tariffs – a key component of both NAFTA and the Trump-era USMCA – markets and the production of goods across North America have become highly interconnected. The trade treaties severely reduced barriers to investment in Mexico, allowing significant American investment in sectors such as agriculture and energy – where U.S. companies were formerly prohibited. Further, manufacturers now rely on processes in which, for example, the average car crosses the border multiple times during production.\nSimilarly, agribusiness has developed symbiotic practices, such that grains, apples and pears are predominantly grown in the United States, while tomatoes, strawberries and avocados are grown in Mexico. Given these processes, the U.S. now exports over US$300 billion of goods and services per year to Mexico, and the stock of U.S. investments in Mexico reached $144 billion in 2023.\nIf Trump abrogates the trade deals and imposes tariffs, he might convince investors to spend their next dollars in the U.S. But if Mexico imposes tariffs, business taxes or investment restrictions, what would happen to investors’ farms and factories already in Mexico?\nPast experience suggests that any disruption to supply chains or U.S. export markets would awaken strong business opposition, as analysts and business groups have already recognized.\nTrump is not immune to pressure from U.S. businesses. During his first administration, companies successfully opposed Trump’s attempt to close the border, arguing that slowing the flow of immigrants also meant slowing trucks full of goods.\nSecurity and immigration\nOn the issue of the border and immigration, while Trump has issued threats, Sheinbaum has stressed the importance of cooperation.\nCurrently, the Mexican government expends significant resources to patrol its own southern border, not to mention dealing with the many potential migrants who gather in its northern cities.\nMexico could demand more support from the U.S. in exchange for this work, plus the costs associated with welcoming back the estimated 4 million Mexicans who are currently in the U.S. without proper documentation.\nThe deportation of undocumented immigrants that Trump has repeatedly promised will require other types of cooperation, such as processing border crossings, and Mexico could slow-walk this process. Mexico has already signaled that it will withhold processing of non-Mexicans.\nThe two countries have a history of collaboration in addressing the illegal drugs trade – but here too there have also been tensions. Toward the end of Trump’s first term, for example, a Mexican general was arrested in the U.S. on drug charges. After a diplomatic uproar, he was returned to Mexico and released.\nIn late November, Sheinbaum noted that she and Trump had discussed security cooperation “within the framework of our sovereignty.” But Trump’s campaign rheotric seemed less concerned with Mexico’s sovereignty, floating the idea of sending troops to the border or even deploying them within Mexico to counter narcotraffickers. That would clearly enrage Mexico, with consequences that would extend far beyond a willingness to cooperate on the issues of drug trafficking.\nA chance for China?\nOne country that stands to benefit should U.S.-Mexican relations deteriorate is China – an issue that Mexico could exploit.\nChina is now the first or second trading partner with nearly every country in Latin America, including Mexico. The value of U.S.-Mexico trade is over $100 billion a year, but the growth of Chinese imports into Mexico has been limited somewhat by rules-of-origin provisions in NAFTA and the USMCA.\nA U.S.-Mexican trade war could weaken or end any incentive to keep Chinese goods out. Further, if the doors to the United States are narrowed through tariffs and hostile rhetoric, China’s car parts and financial services would clearly become even more attractive to Mexican businesses. A U.S.-Mexican trade war, in short, would augment Beijing’s access to a market on the U.S. border.\nA coalition of the concerned?\nIn sum, if Trump goes through with his threats, the result will be costs to consumers and businesses, plus a new opportunity for China. This is likely to foment a coalition of industries, investors, consumers and foreign policy experts concerned with China – many parts of which supported Trump’s campaign.\nScott Morgenstern, Professor of Political Science, University of Pittsburgh",

         "Investigators in South Korea on Wednesday arrested impeached President Yoon Suk-yeol at his residence on charges of insurrection and abuse of power. This stems from his attempt to impose martial law last month in what was essentially a failed coup. He has already been suspended from office following his impeachment on December 14.\nThe Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) along with the National Police Agency carried out the arrest warrant and Yoon was taken in for questioning at the CIO’s headquarters in Gwacheon, just south of Seoul. While other former South Korean presidents have been jailed, Yoon is the first sitting president in the country’s history to be arrested. When not being questioned, Yoon has been held in solitary confinement at the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang.\nThe president was questioned for ten hours on Wednesday, though the CIO stated he largely refused to cooperate. He then refused to attend any sessions yesterday, claiming to be ill. “President Yoon is not well and fully explained his position yesterday (Wednesday) so there is nothing more to be interrogated about,” one of his lawyers, Yun Gap-geun, stated. The CIO has ordered Yoon to attend the 10 a.m. questioning session today.\nAfter his arrest, the president’s lawyers filed for a review of his detention with the Seoul Central District Court. They also filed accusations with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors office against the heads of the CIO, O Dong-un, and the police’s National Office of Investigation, U Jong-su, of “insurrection” against the government for detaining Yoon. They previously claimed that Yoon is immune from prosecution for acts he carries out as president, specifically citing the United States Supreme Court ruling last July that stated a US president has unlimited power.\nThe court rejected several of Yoon’s claims, including that the detention warrant was invalid, that the CIO had no right to investigate Yoon, and that the police had engaged in illegal practices during the arrest. After a 48-hour period of questioning, the CIO will file for an extension of the arrest warrant today. This is a legal step before the case is sent to prosecutors, who have the authority to indict him.\nThe CIO first requested the arrest warrant from the Seoul Western District Court, which granted it on December 31. Yoon had three times refused to respond to summonses for questioning in relation to his martial law declaration on the evening of December 3.\nOn that evening, Yoon ordered military troops and the police to surround the National Assembly and drag lawmakers out of the building before they had an opportunity to vote to lift the martial law decree. However, this failed and parliament, controlled by the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), voted to end martial law. Only after several hours did Yoon agree to comply.\nYoon’s arrest on Wednesday was the second attempt to detain the president after the Presidential Security Service (PSS) and military brigades under PSS control blocked investigators from arresting him on January 3. The president has repeatedly declared that the CIO has no right to investigate his martial law declaration.\nDiscussions on how to carry out the second attempt included suggestions that the police could send in special forces, raising the possibility of an armed battle between the PSS and the police. After his arrest, a pre-recorded video was released in which Yoon stated, “Although it is an illegal investigation, I decided to agree to appear at the CIO in order to prevent ugly bloodshed.”\nThe police deployed thousands of officers to carry out the warrant and prevent clashes. Approximately 1,200 police personnel took part in the actual arrest, ten times the number during the first attempt. Lawmakers from Yoon’s ruling People Power Party (PPP) and members of his legal team attempted to block the entrance to the presidential residence. However, a CIO official told the media, “Unlike during the first attempt, there were no personnel or Presidential Security Service staff actively resisting the execution (of the warrant). There were practically no physical clashes today.”\nThe only clashes that did take place Wednesday were with Yoon’s supporters. Relatively small in number, they are a mob of far-right-wing and fascistic individuals, who have waved South Korean and American flags while carrying “Stop the steal” signs at pro-Yoon rallies in a direct appeal for support from United States imperialism and incoming President Donald Trump. They regularly denounce their political opponents as “communists,” including the CIO.\nDespite his suspension from office and arrest, Yoon remains president. He can only be removed from power by the Constitutional Court, which has 180 days to rule on whether or not his martial law declaration violated the constitution. This means it is entirely possible that Yoon will return to office with all the powers he previously held, including over the military. The first and second formal hearings in the case took place on January 14 and 16 respectively, with which Yoon has largely refused to cooperate.\nThat Yoon is emboldened to stonewall the legal process is an indication that he feels he has enough support within the political establishment. Should he be reinstated, he would no doubt put an end to his criminal case and be in position to carry out retribution against his political opponents and attempt another imposition of martial law to strangle democratic rights.\nHis arrest is also not an indication that the president is throwing in the towel. No doubt, Yoon and his allies in the PPP were concerned that if bloodshed did occur, it would lead to the renewal of mass protests that would negatively impact the ability to maneuver in the courts and behind the scenes to stay in power.\nThose mass protests peaked on December 14 when approximately two million people gathered outside the National Assembly to demand Yoon’s impeachment. Since then, the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), aided by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU), has demobilized the demonstrations, concerned that participants would begin advancing demands that went beyond the confines set by the political establishment, and about the impact on the economy and big business.\nDemocratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae released a statement on Thursday, claiming, “The arrest of Yoon Suk-yeol is a great achievement of the people who have risen up in the middle of winter to save democracy.” Yet the danger to democracy is not the result of the personal inclination for authoritarianism of one individual. It is the result of the crisis of capitalism that is occurring around the globe that is increasingly seeing far-right figures coming to power, notably Trump in the US.\nThe DP however covers this up while presenting Yoon’s removal from power as an already accomplished fact. It is the same type of rhetoric that the DP and its allies used when Yoon was impeached, yet his attempt to block his arrest demonstrated the serious crisis that continues to exist.\nDemocratic lawmaker Wi Seong-rak made clear the real concerns of the party when he recently told Bloomberg, “If the Trump administration applies across-the-board tariffs, that will be a big hit for our firms, the economy and employment when the (South) Korean economy is going slow. We need to give a signal to the market that the (South) Korean government is stabilized, and soon it will be normalized.” The South Korean won, for example, fell 5.3 percent in value against the US dollar in December and has continued to weaken throughout January.\nThe Democratic Party is not leading nor will it lead a defense of democratic rights in South Korea. The working class and youth should take the situation as a serious warning. The Democrats’ downplaying of the danger will only further embolden Yoon and the far-right in South Korea.",

         "On Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s nominees for the director of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Kashyap “Kash” Patel and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, faced multi-hour hearings before the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, respectively.\nThe hearings, like all the rest for Trump’s nominees, were conducted in friendly bipartisan manner. Democrats and Republicans agreed repeatedly in both hearings on the necessity of defending the police and on “national security.”\nIf Patel is confirmed to lead the FBI, he will head an agency with some 38,000 agents, a $9 billion budget, and a history of attacking the democratic rights of the working class in the United States and internationally for over a century. In the case of Gabbard, she would be in charge of coordinating the work of 18 different intelligence agencies charged with spying on the entire planet.\nWhile Democrats in both hearings made clear they would be opposing both nominees, they were quick to add that this was not a “partisan” issue.\nIn opposing Patel for FBI director, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Dick Durbin (Democrat-Illinois) said, “During the time I have served on this committee I have had the opportunity to consider four FBI director nominations. Each one was a Republican and I voted for all of them.”\nDurbin said he would not support Patel for FBI director because he has “virtually no experience” to lead the “preeminent law enforcement agency.” He attacked Patel for characterizing former FBI director Robert Mueller as a “swamp creature” and for his support of Trump’s fascist footsoldiers via the promotion of the “January 6 choir.”\nThe “J6 choir” was comprised of several violent participants in Trump’s failed coup who put out a recording in which they sang the national anthem while in jail. Throughout his 2024 campaign, Trump frequently played the fascist jingle at his rallies and Patel shared it on his social media accounts. Last week, Trump pardoned all members of the “choir.”\nPatel has worked for the US federal government for most of the past 20 years, including in both the Obama and first Trump administration. In Wednesday’s hearing, Patel boasted he was “most proud” of his “work in national security,” including “killing high-value terrorists” as “a joint special operations command civilian, embedded with SEAL team 6 and Delta,” during both the Obama and Trump administrations.\nTo say Patel is a “Trump loyalist” would be an understatement. He is a board member of Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Trump’s social media platform Truth Social. He is also the author of several books of pro-Trump propaganda, including Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy. He has also authored a children’s book series titled, “The Plot Against the King” which casts himself as a magical wizard protecting the “merchant” Trump from “Hillary Queenton” and the “Russionians.”\nDuring the first Trump administration, Patel worked with Rep. Devin Nunes (R-California) to expose the supposed role of congressional Democrats collaborating with elements in the FBI to frame Trump as an agent of Russia. This earned him a place by Trump’s side at the National Security Council. He played a critical role in the preparation of Trump’s coup, after his electoral defeat in November 2020. Trump purged Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and replaced him with special forces colonel Christopher Miller as acting secretary, with Patel as his chief of staff and, in effect, White House liaison.\nDuring the attack on the Capitol, Patel slow-rolled the deployment of Pentagon assets to the Capitol as it was under siege and well after members of Congress and D.C. National Guard Commander, William Walker, requested authorization from Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy and Miller.\nDespite being interviewed by the January 6 House Select Committee, Patel’s name is not mentioned once in the “Final Report” issued in December 2022. This is not a mistake, but underscores the cover-up character of the committee. Its purpose was not to uncover the full extent of Trump’s coup, but to instead limit its focus to Trump and conceal the role played by major institutions of capitalist class rule, including the Republican Party, Supreme Court, and the military, police and intelligence apparatus.\nThis cover-up continued in Wednesday’s hearing. While Democrats frequently brought up Patel’s books and his subservience to Trump, they did not question him over his actions on January 6 itself. Instead, Democrats focused almost all their objections to Patel on previous social media postings he made threatening to go after Trump’s “deep state” enemies, including a list that was printed in the back of his book Government Gangsters.\nRepublicans, including Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, used their time to allow Patel to rewrite the history of January 6 so as to cast former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser as responsible for the delay in deploying the D.C. National Guard. Patel claimed that the response of the Guard was delayed in part because they did not get a “lawful request from the governing authority which was the mayor of DC and the Speaker of the House.”\nIn fact, as “commander-in-chief” President Trump was the “governing authority” who at any moment could have ordered not only the deployment of the DC National Guard, but any number of military and police units to defend Congress from the far-right mob. That he didn’t underscores that the nearly four-hour delay was not a “mistake” but intentional.\nWhile it is likely Patel will be confirmed with Republican votes alone, Gabbard’s nomination for Director of National Intelligence is in jeopardy after she refused to condemn National Security Administration (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden during Wednesday’s hearing.\nGabbard is one of handful of US politicians that has condemned the treatment of Snowden. In 2013, the former government contractor exposed the illegal surveillance operations of the NSA, CIA and other US spy agencies which target millions in the US and around the world. For over a decade, Snowden has remained exiled in Russia after the US government revoked his passport.\nRanking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee Mark Warner (Virginia), speaking for the intelligence apparatus, said, “I have serious doubts about your judgment... You consistently praised the actions of Edward Snowden. Someone who I believe jeopardized the security of our nation and then, to flaunt that, fled to Russia.\n“You’ve called Edward Snowden, and I’ll quote here, ‘A brave whistleblower’.”\nWarner claimed that Snowden “wasn’t a whistleblower and in this case, I’m a lot closer to the chairman’s words, where he said Snowden is quote, ‘an egotistical serial liar and traitor’ who quote, ‘deserves to rot in jail for the rest of his life.’”\nWarner asked Gabbard if she still thought Snowden was “brave.” Gabbard did not directly answer the question, stating instead that Snowden, “broke the law” and that she did not agree with how he acted, or everything he released to journalists but that, “the fact is, he also, even as he broke the law, released information that exposed egregious, illegal, and unconstitutional programs that are happening within our government that led to serious reforms that Congress undertook.”\nWarner repeatedly asked Gabbard to denounce Snowden or recant her previous characterization of him as “brave.” Gabbard declined but promised to “protect our nation’s secrets” and “prevent another Snowden-like leak.”\nThis was not enough for Warner who replied, “I don’t think you are the answer. I agree with Tom Cotton, he’s a traitor.”",

         "Beijing, Dec 2 (Xinhua) – US President Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, on Sunday night, reversing his earlier stance of not using executive power to pardon or reduce his son’s sentence.\n“From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted… it is clear that Hunter was treated differently,” Biden said in a statement.\nThe president said his political opponents in Congress “instigated” the charges “to attack me and oppose my election.”\n“No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son—and that is wrong,” he said.\nBiden said he had decided to issue the executive grant of clemency for his son “for those offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from Jan 1, 2014, through Dec 1, 2024.”\nBack in 2014, Hunter joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that has featured prominently in investigations of his past business dealings, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nHunter was convicted in June for purchasing a firearm in 2018 while addicted to crack cocaine, marking the first time a sitting president’s child has been convicted of a crime. He is set to be sentenced on Dec 12.\nHe is also scheduled to be sentenced on Dec 16 for federal tax evasion charges, to which he pleaded guilty in September. The charges involved over $1.4 million in unpaid taxes.\nSpecial Counsel David Weiss, who served as the attorney for Delaware under former US President Donald Trump, launched an investigation into Hunter in 2018 and brought both indictments in 2023.\nBiden Calls Russia’s Retaliatory Strikes on Ukrainian Military Sites ‘Outrageous’\nThrough pardoning his son, Biden has ratted on a public pledge that he made repeatedly before and after dropping out of the 2024 presidential race, CNN reported, adding that both the president and his top White House spokesperson said unequivocally, including after Trump won the 2024 election, that he would not pardon Hunter or commute his sentence.\nPresident-elect Trump posted on his social media platform, saying, “Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!”\n“In pardoning his son Hunter Biden on Sunday night, the incumbent president sounded a lot like his successor by complaining about selective prosecution and political pressure, questioning the fairness of a system that Mr. Biden had until now long defended,” the New York Times reported.\nIn a statement by Trump’s transition team to Fox News, Steven Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson, said the Democrat-controlled Department of Justice and other radical prosecutors are guilty of weaponizing the justice system. “That system of justice must be fixed, and due process must be restored for all Americans.”\nThe Guardian, a British newspaper, raised the question of whether it is “a loving act of mercy by a father who has already known much sorrow?” Or “a hypocritical political maneuver reminiscent of his great foe?”\nDemocratic Governor of Colorado Jared Polis wrote on X that, “While as a father I certainly understand President Biden’s natural desire to help his son by pardoning him, I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country. This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.”\nReaders from different newspapers also made their voices heard. “Crazy. Trump is now free to Pardon himself. Well done Biden,” one from the Financial Times wrote. Another WSJ reader commented, “Joe Biden makes Bill Clinton look like an honest man.”\nThis is not the first case of a US president pardoning a family member.\nIn 2001, Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother Roger Clinton for a 1985 cocaine-related offense. In 2020, Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, his daughter Ivanka’s father-in-law and the selected next US ambassador to France, who had been convicted of witness tampering, tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions.",

         "President Joe Biden’s farewell address on Wednesday night was a blend of self-congratulatory rhetoric and fantastical claims about the successes of the four years of his administration. Amidst the platitudes, Biden made one statement that briefly acknowledged the grim reality of American society.\n“I want to warn the country of some things that give me great concern,” Biden said. “And that’s the dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra-wealthy people. Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms...”\nInvoking Eisenhower’s 1961 farewell address, in which the retiring president and former general warned about the dangers of a “military-industrial complex,” Biden referred to the rise of what he called a “tech-industrial complex, that could pose real dangers for our country as well.”\nWhile Biden spoke in conditional terms about “potential” developments that are “taking shape,” the oligarchic character of American society is already an entrenched reality, cultivated over decades by the very system he defends.\nIt is easy enough to point to the staggering hypocrisy of Biden’s comments, which present the consolidation of oligarchic control as if his own administration had nothing to do with it. According to Bloomberg News, during Biden’s four years in office, the wealth of the 100 richest Americans grew by $1.5 trillion—a 63 percent increase. Prominent figures within what Biden referred to as the “tech-industrial complex” have seen their fortunes skyrocket. Elon Musk’s wealth has grown sixteenfold, from $25 billion in 2020 to over $415 billion. Jeff Bezos’s wealth has doubled, and Mark Zuckerberg’s has nearly quadrupled.\nAs Biden leaves office, he speaks of an oligarchy that he and the Democratic Party have played a central role in fostering and expanding, including through the massive bipartisan bank bailouts in 2008 and 2020. Biden’s central focus as president was to get the public to resume “normal” economic life during a raging pandemic, with the explicit aim of driving down wages and reducing costs for major corporations.\nThere is something deeply pathetic about a man who has been in the White House for the last four years and served for decades as the senator from Delaware, the center of corporate tax evasion, now posturing as an opponent of the oligarchy.\nMore fundamentally, Biden could not and did not address the origins of this oligarchy or its intrinsic connection to the social and economic system, capitalism, that he and the entire political establishment defend.\nWe don’t know whether Biden or his staff have read the World Socialist Web Site, but Biden essentially confirmed, from the horse’s mouth, the analysis of the Trotskyist movement over an extended period of time and, in particular, in relation to the re-election of Donald Trump.\n“Donald Trump speaks not simply as one criminal individual,” the WSWS wrote in its initial statement following the election, “but as the representative of a powerful capitalist oligarchy that has taken shape over the last three to four decades. Mega-millionaires and billionaires—led by the likes of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel and Larry Ellison—are utilizing Trump to effect in their interests a reactionary restructuring of American society.”\nThe WSWS not only analyzed the social basis of the destruction of democratic forms of rule, it advanced a proposal for what to do about it. Following the election, on November 20, the Socialist Equality Party organized an online meeting under the headline, “Of, by and for the oligarchy: Trump’s cabinet & the restructuring of the American state,” focused precisely on this issue.\nAddressing the significance of Trump’s re-election, WSWS International Editorial Board Chairman David North explained that “the oligarchic character of social relations in this country, the vast concentration of wealth in a relative handful of people, is absolutely incompatible with a democratic system.” North added, “The constituency for democracy in its modern form can only come through the development of a mass movement of the working class, the fight against the capitalist system, the transfer of ownership of the means of production and control of society to the broad mass of the people.”\nIn its New Year statement, “Socialism against oligarchy, fascism and war,” the WSWS drew the connection between the capitalist oligarchy and the entire policy of the ruling class, including the homicidal response to the pandemic, which has killed millions, and the escalating global war, which threatens all of mankind.\n“Underlying these interlinked crises,” we wrote, “is an oligarchy that subordinates all of society to profit and the accumulation of personal wealth. The fight against the oligarchy is by its very nature a revolutionary task. Its wealth must be expropriated and its stranglehold over economic and political life abolished.”\nThe present social reality is the outcome of an extended historical process. Biden’s reference to Eisenhower reveals more than he intended. When Eisenhower issued his warning in 1961, American capitalism was at the height of its global dominance. Sixty-four years later, Biden speaks as the aging representative of a ruling class that is rotting on its feet.\nThe Democratic Party proposes and can propose nothing to address the reality to which Biden briefly alluded. Despite sporadic references to the “danger” of Trump and his authoritarian politics, the Democratic Party has consistently downplayed the threat of fascism and has now dropped it altogether. In his farewell address, Biden repeated his previous statement, “I wish the incoming administration success,” which was his only actual reference to the government to which he will be handing power.\nThe idea that this administration can be opposed within the existing political framework, or without a direct assault on the wealth and power of the oligarchy, is sheer fantasy. The ruling class has made clear its intentions: to dismantle democratic rights, crush dissent, and impose austerity on the working class while enriching the financial oligarchy. The only way forward is through a direct assault on the wealth and power of the oligarchs. Their stranglehold over society must be broken through the expropriation of their wealth and the reorganization of economic life on the basis of social need, not private profit.\nThis task is inseparably bound up with the fight for socialism. The Socialist Equality Party and the World Socialist Web Site have consistently warned of the consequences of the deepening crisis of capitalism, from the rise of fascistic politics to the escalating global imperialist war.\nAs Trump returns to the White House, the SEP is spearheading the fight for a socialist movement of the working class in the US and internationally. This is the basic and urgent political task.",

         "Daily Caller News Foundation co-founder Tucker Carlson released a video on social media Tuesday from Moscow, revealing how the U.S. government has not only severed all communication ties with Russia but also prevented Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from interviewing with Carlson and his team.\nTensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated last month after President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles on Nov. 17 for strikes inside Russia. In a video posted to X, Carlson told viewers how U.S. involvement in the conflict has brought everyone closer to a nuclear confrontation since he last interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin in February.\n“In that time, just a few weeks ago, the Biden administration, American military personnel launched missiles into mainland Russia and killed at least a dozen Russian soldiers. So we are, unbeknownst to most Americans, in a hot war with Russia, an undeclared war, a war you did not vote for and that most Americans don’t want, but it is ongoing,” Carlson said. “Because of that war, because of the fact that the U.S. military is killing Russians in Russia right now, we are closer to nuclear war than at any time in history, far closer than we were during the Cuban Missile Crisis.”\nCarlson went on to highlight how, despite believing that someone in Washington, D.C., was behind the push toward nuclear war, he had uncovered that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had cut off “all contact” between Russia and the United States.\n“We felt there must be someone behind the scenes in Washington working to make sure that this conflict doesn’t become a nuclear holocaust. But we found out that no, in fact, there is nobody. Tony Blinken, the current secretary of state, cut off all contact between the U.S. and Russian governments. There is no back channel. There is no conversation. There hasn’t been for more than two years,” Carlson said.\nWATCH:\n“Meanwhile, most Americans have no access to any perspective other than that granted to them by NBC News and The New York Times. They don’t know how close we are. They don’t know the Russian perspective,” Carlson said. “We’ve been trying for over a year to get that perspective out to American news consumers.”\nCarlson also noted that he had been attempting for over a year to interview Zelenskyy but had been “thwarted” by the U.S. government’s involvement.\n“The American embassy in Kiev, which our tax dollars pay for, told the Zelenskyy government, ‘No, you may not do the interview.’ You can talk to CNN. You can’t talk to us. So we’ve been unable to speak to him,” Carlson said.\n“So we came back to Moscow yesterday to interview the foreign minister of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, the longest serving foreign minister in the world … and ask him, where exactly are we? Are we headed toward an unprecedented conflict between Russia and the United States? Is there any way to peel Russia back from the east, from the sphere of China, back in to the west? Is that alliance permanent? Does the election of Donald Trump mean an end to this war, which is reshaping the world, the U.S. economy, the global economy and risking the life of every person on this planet? Is that possible? We just walked out of that interview,” Carlson added. “It’s absolutely fascinating.”\nTalks of nuclear war surfaced after Biden authorized the use of U.S. long-range missiles for Ukraine, with Putin warning Ukraine about the potential use of new hypersonic missiles to target government or official buildings in Kyiv. Despite the signaling from Putin, U.S. intelligence sources allegedly told Reuters in late November that the decision to allow Ukraine the use of U.S. missiles has not increased the risk of nuclear war.",

         "Trump has pushed for a deal on Ukraine’s $500 billion in rare earth minerals, but some say the estimated value is based on old data and exaggerated.\nKyiv and the United States are in the final stages of negotiating a minerals deal, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 24.\nThe deal is seen as key to ending the three-year Russia–Ukraine conflict, with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy having previously stressed that any such deal must involve concrete security guarantees.\n“Ukrainian and U.S. teams are in the final stages of negotiations regarding the minerals agreement. The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,” Stefanishyna wrote in a Feb. 24 post on social media platform X. “We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington (at) the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.”\nLast month, President Donald Trump said that Ukraine had “essentially agreed” to give the U.S. access to $500 billion worth of deposits of rare earths and critical minerals.\nHe said the United States is owed “more than $300 billion, probably $350 [billion]” for its support to Ukraine and that Europe is “in for probably $100 billion.”\n“I told [Ukraine] that I want the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earth [minerals], and they’ve essentially agreed to do that,” Trump said.\nZelenskyy said that Ukraine has Europe’s largest reserves of titanium, used in aerospace, automotive, and medical industries, as well as uranium, the primary fuel source for nuclear power reactors and weapon production.\nMany of the titanium deposits were marked in northwestern Ukraine, far from the fighting, he said.\nHe claimed that Russia knew in detail where Ukraine’s critical resources were from Soviet-era geological surveys.\nHe also said that Kyiv and the White House were discussing the idea of using Ukraine’s large underground gas storage sites to store U.S. liquefied natural gas.\n‘Breathless Fantasy’\nUkraine’s rare earths and minerals may not be that easy to extract.\nAccording to a Feb. 13 report by rating agency S&P’s global commodity insights team, Ukraine is “relying on a Soviet-era assessment of difficult-to-access rare earths deposits.”\n“Some are stuck behind battle lines or, in the case of the geological record for one of the sites, require advanced processing technology and a stable energy grid to extract,” the report said, adding that the valuation of the deposits is based on “decades-old data.”\nBy Owen Evans",

         "We’ve warned about it for years….\nAfter decades of importing violent immigrants into this Country, it’s felt like a ticking time bomb.\nWere massive sleeper cell networks being created?\nAnd held in the Deep State’s back pocket?\nWhat would they save them for? Probably something very important right.\nPerhaps, oh I don’t know, assume four lawsuits fail to stop President Trump, two impeachments fail to stop him, one bullet fails to stop him by mere centimeters, then a second gunman also fails, then election rigging and MSM election interference fails to stop him and he’s elected the 47th President of the United States….\nAnd then imagine you know that he’s going to undue every last ounce of the Deep State over the next four years because he has nothing to lose at this point, considering he’ll be in his second term….\nAnd imagine you have a strong desire for self-preservation as the Deep State, what would you do?\nWould you have a contingency plan in your back pocket?\nWould you have a network of Sleeper Cells all over the USA that you could deploy at your convenience?\nTo what purpose?\nTo destroy and destabilize the nation so much that perhaps Martial Law must be declared and Trump will not be allowed to take office?\nBut that’s all just crazy talk right?\nI hope so.\nBut there’s a reason I’ve been warning you very loudly the last two months….remember this?\nDeep state plot to keep Trump out of the White House revealed\nAnd this?\nExpert Says Not Even Trump Can Stop WW3\nWell, I wish I had been wrong on those, but on Day 1 of 2025, it looks like they're playing out exactly as I feared.\nIt's not just my opinion Cernovich just told you too:\nTrump as well:\nBut now let's go deeper, because the ties here between the two events are pretty incredible.\nHere's a good start of all the strange similarities:\n2 electric vehicles\nBoth rented from Turo\nBoth contained explosives\nBoth attackers died\nThe Airbnb in New Orleans burns down\nThe Cybertruck was outside of TRUMP tower\nIt’s Jan 1st and the cybertruck had fireworks\nJust a coincidence, right?\nElon Musk himself posted that he thinks they may be linked:\nMore here:\nCyberTruck bomber:\n-Found with gunshot wound to his head\n-Fort Bragg, like the New Orleans driver\n-Rented from Turo, like in New Orleans\n-Same day as the New Orleans attack\n-Green Beret military bomb expert\n-Yet he used amateur explosives\nBoth attackers strangely have ties to Fort Bragg -- is that where they were radicalized?\nWhat happened at Fort Bragg?\nBoth just randomly chose to rent from Turo?\nNot only that, but the white Ford truck seen ahead of the Cybertruck at the Trump Hotel was also rented from Turo:\nI know, I know....all just strange coincidences.\nBut it's not just me.\nThe authorities have also noticed all the similarities and they discussed them here:\nI think Charlie Kirk sums it up nicely with this:\nAnd now I want to end with this analysis from MeetKevin, which goes even deeper and I think does a great job of linking several things together.\nHe also has some other theories.\nWatch here:\nFULL TRANSCRIPT:",

The release of the political prisoners has already begun, including Enrique Tarrio, who was sentenced to over 20 years and but was never in Washington DC on January 6th.\nOther J6er families have begun to share their joy with fellow patriots via X as they prepare to welcome home their persecuted loved ones.\nHowever, not all of the J6ers will be given a “full, complete and unconditional.” Fourteen have had their sentences commuted, which means they will be released, however, they will not have all of their rights restored, such as, typically, the ability to own and possess firearms, voting rights, and holding public office.\nThe list of those who received commutations:\nThe Gateway Pundit has covered most of those commuted, but they were all members of either the Oath Keepers or the Proud Boys. Stewart Rhodes is the Founder of the Oath Keepers and Ethan Nordean is a leader in the Proud Boys and Zachary Rehl is a leader of the Philadelphia chapter. The majority were convicted of “seditious conspiracy.”\nRhodes was not convicted of a violent crime, however, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison.",

         "JERUSALEM – With the release of the first three hostages on Sunday – named as Romi Gonen, Emily Damari, and Doron Steinbracher, all of whom are women – thoughts inevitably turn to just how much is being demanded in return with the potential release of more than 1,600 Palestinian prisoners, including more than 700 convicted murdrerers, if all the phases of the deal were to be completed.\nAs with the deal which secured the release of IDF soldier Gilad Schalit in 2011 – during which Israel’s current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was also in charge – there seems to be a distinct imbalance as to the price Israel is being asked to pay. It must be remembered, the psychopathic former Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, who masterminded and orchestrated the Oct. 7 attacks – and who was imprisoned for killing Palestinians – was let out during that agreement. Despite the fact he was thankfully killed in October during a routine IDF operation in Gaza, the potential parallels are too stark to be overlooked.\nAnd people should be under no illusions that any of these people are reformed characters. Indeed, one of Hamas’ leaders Khalil al-Hayya, praised the Oct. 7 attacks, while threatening a repeat of them, which seems a strange thing to do for a people who were reportedly the victims of a genocide.\nThis rogues’ gallery includes the likes of the following:\nAhmad Barghouti, a close aide and cousin of Marwan Barghouti, sentenced to 13 life terms for leading a “murder machine” that carried out attacks in which 12 Israelis were killed, including the suicide bombing at the Seafood Market restaurant in Tel Aviv.\nWael Qassem (head of the cell), Wassam Abbasi, Mohammed Odeh, members of Hamas’s “Silwan Cell,” responsible for attacks which killed 35 Israelis, including the bombing at Café Moment in Jerusalem where 11 Israelis were killed, the attack at the Spaghettim Club in Rishon LeZion where 15 Israelis were killed, and the bombing at the Frank Sinatra Cafeteria at the Hebrew University where 9 Israelis were killed.\nZakaria Zubeidi is a former commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades in Jenin, responsible for a series of attacks, including the attack at the Likud branch in Beit She’an where 6 Israelis were killed. He was also one of the terrorists who escaped from Gilboa Prison in 2021. Since he was not convicted of murder but other offenses, Zubeidi will not be deported abroad and is expected to be released back to Judea and Samaria.\nAbdullah Sharabati, Majdi Zaatari, and Samer Alatrash, members of the cell responsible for a series of attacks on bus lines 2 and 14 in Jerusalem in 2003, one of which killed 23 Israelis, including 7 children, and carried out the suicide bombing on line 6 in the French Hill where seven Israelis were killed and 20 were injured. They planned a long series of additional attacks.\nMohammed Amoudi, who dispatched the suicide bomber for the attack at the “Mayor’s Shawarma” stand in Tel Aviv in 2006, killing 11 people.\nMohammed Abu Warda, who sent the suicide bombers for the attacks on line 18 in Jerusalem in 1996, attacks in which 45 Israelis were killed. He is serving 48 life sentences in an Israeli prison.\nMahmoud Atallah, a life prisoner who murdered a Palestinian woman, and during his time in a security prison, was accused of raping a female guard as part of the pimping scandal in Gilboa Prison. He will not be deported but will be released to Judea and Samaria.\nNour Jaber, a terrorist responsible for the murder of 16 Israelis: dispatched the suicide attacks on the worshipers’ route in Hebron in 2002 where 12 Israelis were killed, including Brigade Commander Dror Weinberg, and the attack in Atzmona in 2002 where four Israelis were killed.\nSami Jaradat, one of the terrorists responsible for the attack at Maxim Restaurant in Haifa in 2003, where 21 Israelis were killed.\nAli Sufuri, a senior Islamic Jihad terrorist responsible for the murder of nine Israelis and the wounding of more than 100 in a series of attacks: the car bomb explosion at the central station in Hadera where 45 Israelis were injured, the shooting attack at the market in Hadera where four Israelis were killed, the suicide bombing at the Check Post junction where 29 civilians were injured, and many more attacks.\nOmar Al-Zaben, one of the leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, responsible for a long series of attacks in which 27 Israelis were killed, sentenced to 27 life terms in prison.\nRamadan Mashahra, one of the terrorists involved in the suicide bombing in the Gilo neighborhood in Jerusalem in 2002, where 19 Israelis were killed.\nShadi Amouri, one of the planners of the car bomb attack at the Megiddo junction in 2002, where 17 were killed.\nThabet Mardawi, a senior Islamic Jihad operative responsible for a series of attacks during the Second Intifada in which 21 were killed and nearly 200 wounded.\nIsraelis caught between relief and outrage\nAfter more than 15 long months of war, Israelis are experiencing acute levels of fatigue. While the prospect of the return of some hostages – it seems as unlikely today as it did on Oct. 8 all will be returned – is welcomed and anyone with a soul rejoices at the prospect of the emotional reunions of families torn asunder on that blackest of Sabbaths in October 2023, there is also a deep sense of foreboding. It feels like we’ve been here before. The prime minister makes certain pronouncements that assurances have been given and the IDF will be able to return to Gaza etc, but wars have their own momentum, and once they have been stopped, it’s difficult to reanimate them, whatever the justice and justification for doing so.\nIt is almost inevitable many if not nearly all of the most hardened murderers being released in this deal, will go right back to either plotting and/ or carrying out the murders of Israelis. While it is true some will be exiled, there are also a number who will be returned to Judea and Samaria, and it is here the closest eye will need to be cast on their activities.\nThey’re home! 3 female former hostages – Romi Gonen, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher – arrive back in Israel",

My take is extreme threat level not extreme weather.\nPresident-elect Trump on Truth Social:\nJanuary 20th cannot come fast enough! Everybody, even those that initially opposed a Victory by President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Administration, just want it to happen. It is my obligation to protect the People of our Country but, before we even begin, we have to think of the Inauguration itself. The weather forecast for Washington, D.C., with the windchill factor, could take temperatures into severe record lows. There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country. I don’t want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way. It is dangerous conditions for the tens of thousands of Law Enforcement, First Responders, Police K9s and even horses, and hundreds of thousands of supporters that will be outside for many hours on the 20th (In any event, if you decide to come, dress warmly!).\nStory continues below advertisement\nTherefore, I have ordered the Inauguration Address, in addition to prayers and other speeches, to be delivered in the United States Capitol Rotunda, as was used by Ronald Reagan in 1985, also because of very cold weather. The various Dignitaries and Guests will be brought into the Capitol. This will be a very beautiful experience for all, and especially for the large TV audience!\nWe will open Capital One Arena on Monday for LIVE viewing of this Historic event, and to host the Presidential Parade. I will join the crowd at Capital One, after my Swearing In.\nAll other events will remain the same, including the Victory Rally at Capital One Arena, on Sunday at 3 P.M. (Doors open at 1 P.M.—Please arrive early!), and all three Inaugural Balls on Monday evening.\nEveryone will be safe, everyone will be happy, and we will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\nDonald Trump Truth Social 11:55 AM EST 01/17/25\nExtremely cold weather will force Trump’s inauguration inside for first time in 40 years\nBy Samuel Chamberlain and Diana Glebova, NY Jan. 17, 2025:\nDonald Trump will be sworn in as the 47th president inside the Capitol Rotunda on Monday, when a polar vortex is forecast to grip the nation’s capital.\nThe president-elect announced the change of plans in a noontime Truth Social post Friday, writing in part: “There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country. I don’t want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way. It is dangerous conditions for the tens of thousands of Law Enforcement, First Responders, Police K9s and even horses, and hundreds of thousands of supporters that will be outside for many hours on the 20th (In any event, if you decide to come, dress warmly!).\n“Therefore, I have ordered the Inauguration Address, in addition to prayers and other speeches, to be delivered in the United States Capitol Rotunda, as was used by Ronald Reagan in 1985, also because of very cold weather.”\nThe flag-draped casket of former President Jimmy Carter lies in state at the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol, Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2025, in Washington. 4\nTrump will be sworn in as the 47th president inside the Capitol Rotunda. AP\nThe Monday forecast for DC calls for high temperatures of 22 degrees Fahrenheit, with an overnight low of 7 degrees.\nThat’s downright balmy compared to Reagan’s second inauguration, which was also held in the Rotunda as the noon temperature reached 7 degrees, with the afternoon wind chill making it feel between negative-10 and negative-20 degrees.\nSince that day in 1985, the temperature for a presidential swearing-in has only fallen below freezing once: in 2009, when Barack Obama took the oath of office in 28-degree weather.\nThe incoming president’s team had been blasting out invitations for supporters to come to the National Mall to see the outdoor ceremony, which often draws thousands of attendees stretching as far back as the Lincoln Memorial.\nKeep reading….",

         "President Trump has endorsed Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) for Speaker of the House.\n“We are the Party of COMMON SENSE, a primary reason that we WON, in a landslide, the magnificent and historic Presidential Election of 2024. ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, 312 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES, AND THE POPULAR VOTE BY MILLIONS OF VOTERS (Despite large scale voter fraud taking place in numerous states, including California, where votes are ridiculously still being counted, or under review!), ALL WON WITH EASE, CALM, & PROFESSIONALISM,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.\n“Republicans are being praised for having run a ‘legendary’ campaign! Democrats are being excoriated for their effort, having wasted 2.5 Billion Dollars, much of it unaccounted for, with some being used to illegally buy endorsements ($11,000,000 to Beyoncé, who never even sang a song, $2,000,000 to Oprah for doing next to nothing, and even $500,000 to Reverend AL, a professional con man and instigator, who agreed to ‘interview’ their ‘star spangled’ candidates, Kamala and Joe). We ran a flawless campaign, having spent FAR LESS, with lots of money left over,” he continued.\n“They ran a very expensive ‘sinking ship,’ embracing DOJ & FBI WEAPONIZATION against their political opponent, ME. BUT IT DIDN’T WORK, IT WAS A DISASTER!!! LETS NOT BLOW THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY WHICH WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN. The American people need IMMEDIATE relief from all of the destructive policies of the last Administration,” he added.\n“Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hard working, religious man. He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement. MAGA!!!” Trump concluded.\nA closer look:\nThe Hill reports:\nTrump’s public endorsement could be key to a win by Johnson, who can only afford a handful of GOP defections and be elected Speaker.\nAnger from GOP members about how Johnson has handled various issues, including the end-of-year funding package to keep the government open, has thrown Johnson’s Speakership into question.\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has said he will not support Johnson, and several other hard-line conservatives will not commit to supporting him.\nBecause of the razor-thin House GOP majority, Johnson cannot afford to lose more than one Republican vote for Speaker, assuming every member is present and votes for a candidate.\n“Thank you, President Trump! I’m honored and humbled by your support, as always. Together, we will quickly deliver on your America First agenda and usher in the new golden age of America,” Johnson said.\n“The American people demand and deserve that we waste no time. Let’s get to work!” he added.\n“I respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan. We’ve seen Johnson partner with the democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) warned.\nPer CNN:\nMembers had been preparing for a Trump endorsement, one source told CNN. But the same source warned that it may not be enough.\nJohnson allies are keeping close tabs on members who have not committed to backing him yet, including Rep. Victoria Spartz.\nThe source told CNN that Spartz is viewed as unpredictable and that there are “also six or seven other members” who similarly remain wildcards.\nOver the last several weeks, Johnson’s deputies have launched an expansive whip operation, but there are still intense challenges to getting Johnson to 218 votes – the magic number needed to win the gavel.\nOne Republican member familiar with the outreach told CNN that while the vast majority of GOP members understand how “monumentally stupid” it could be to have an extensive speaker’s battle, not every member is swayed by an argument that the party needs to be united going into the inauguration.",

         "This article originally appeared on The Gateway Pundit and was republished with permission.\nGuest post by Brian Lupo\nThe Kannapolis Police Department issued a news release on Thursday announcing that Edgar Maddison Welch was shot to death by police during a traffic stop on Saturday evening.\nAccording to the release on the Kannapolis Fire and Police Facebook page, sometime around 10pm on January 4th, a Kannapolis Police Officer saw a 2001 GMC Yukon and recognized the vehicle “as one normally driven by an individual who he had previously arrested and knew had an outstanding warrant for arrest.” The warrant was reportedly for Felony Probation Violation.\nNo other cause for initiating the traffic stop was given.\nAs the initiating officer was speaking with the driver, two additional officers arrived on scene. The initiating officer recognized the passenger as the individual with the outstanding warrant. According to the news release:\nThe officer who initiated the traffic stop approached the passenger side of the vehicle and opened the front passenger’s door to arrest the individual. When he opened the door, the front seat passenger pulled a handgun from his jacket and pointed it in the direction of the officer. That officer and a second officer who was standing at the rear passenger side of the Yukon gave commands for the passenger to drop the gun. After the passenger failed to comply with their repeated requests, both officers fired their duty weapon at the passenger, striking him.\nWelch was transported to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries on January 6th. The officers who fired their service weapons were placed on administrative leave, as is standard protocol, and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation is investigating the shooting.\nEdgar Maddison Welch was sentenced to four years in prison in June 2017 for an incident involving an AR-15 rifle and a revolver. Welch fired into a door of a Northwest Washington DC pizza restaurant, sending employees and customers scattering, according to a Department of Justice release in 2017.\nWelch plead guilty to a federal charge of interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition and a District of Columbia charge of assault with a dangerous weapon. He was sentenced by now-Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\nAccording to a FOX News report from that timeframe, Welch’s shooting at the door conveniently hit a computer that was stored in the closet with a digitized keypad for “bags” and a “coat closet.”\nThe restaurant the crime was committed at was the Comet Ping Pong Pizza restaurant, which was at the center of what the media calls the ‘PizzaGate’ “conspiracy theory.” ‘PizzaGate’ alleged that a child sex-trafficking ring was being run out the restaurant. This was based on the WikiLeaks of former Chief of Staff to President Clinton and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, John Podesta.\nIn June 2023, the Wall Street Journal ran a story titled Instagram Algorithm Readily Spreads Underage Sexual Content, WSJ Investigation Finds. In that report, they stated:\nSome Instagram users utilize codes to very thinly veil their activity. A map emoji could represent an account appealing to “minor-attracted persons,” while “cheese pizza” could stand for child pornography.\nFormer CBS Atlanta anchor Ben Swann was fired in January 2018 after he revived the story of ‘PizzaGate’ during a segment called Reality Check with Ben Swann.\nDuring the segment, Swann mentioned that “pizza” was a codeword used by pedophiles and that Podesta had “dozens” of emails that mention “pizza,” including one that mentions a handkerchief with a map to pizza.\nAdditionally, Comet Ping Pong Pizza is referenced “at least a dozen or so times” in the Podesta emails. The owner of the restaurant, James Alefantis, is a friend of Podesta, according to Swann’s reporting. Ironically, Alefantis was also named as one of GQ’s “Top 50 Most Powerful People in D.C.”\nSwann acknowledges that there is “no solid evidence” that Comet Ping Pong is being used to traffic children. However, he does mention a 2007 unclassified FBI report that shows logos typically used by pedophiles to express their preference in children.\nCoincidentally, the pizza place next door to Comet Ping Pong, Besta Pizza, had a similar design to their logo, which they changed to remove the controversial part a few weeks before Swann’s report.\nSwann then pointed out two bands that have performed at Comet Ping Pong in 2016 called Heavy Breathing and Sex Stains. Heavy Breathing had YouTube videos posted that “joke” about pedophilia while Sex Stains had a video that included one of the 2007 unclassified report’s symbols for pedophilia.\nThe owner, Alefantis, was previously in a relationship with Media Matters founder David Brock. On Alefantis’s private social media accounts, Swann claimed there were pictures “too disturbing to share on TV” and too disturbing to even describe on his report.\nWelch, back in 2017, had come to the restaurant to ‘self-investigate’ the PizzaGate claims. He used the rifle to blow open a locked door after a failed attempt with a butter knife. After about 20 minutes inside the restaurant alone, he exited the building with the weapons left inside.\nDespite Mockingbird Media claims that ‘PizzaGate’ has been debunked, there has never been an official investigation in the claims.\nCopyright 2025 The Gateway Pundit",

         "What do you think of what Trump said?",
         "https://patriotjournal.org/app/uploads/2024/12/trump-hunter.png",
         "President Joe Biden has done it. He pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, right before leaving office. The decision was a shocking U-turn from Biden’s repeated claims that he would never use his presidential power to shield his son from justice.\nIn the past, Biden assured Americans that Hunter would face the same legal scrutiny as anyone else if he broke the law. But as his presidency winds down, the president seems to have changed his tune. Americans are left wondering: is this about justice or family ties?\nThe move has sparked outrage across the country. Critics say it’s a blatant example of a two-tiered justice system. Democrats, they argue, live by one set of rules, while everyday Americans get stuck with the harsh consequences.\nAnd now, Donald Trump has issued a blistering rebuke.\nFrom The Post Millennial:\nPresident-elect Donald Trump responded to President Joe Biden’s pardon of his son Hunter on Sunday night, saying the real “miscarriage of Justice” is the ongoing imprisonment and prosecution of the J6 protesters. “Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages,” he asked, “who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!” Biden’s statement on the pardon of his son said that “politics” had gotten in the way of justice and that had created a “miscarriage of justice.”\nTrump’s Response: “What About the J6 Protesters?”\nFormer President Donald Trump didn’t hold back. On Sunday night, he slammed Biden’s pardon as the real “miscarriage of justice.” Trump questioned whether Hunter’s pardon would extend to the January 6 protesters, many of whom have been locked up for years.\n“Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages?” Trump quipped. His point was sharp: Biden seems more willing to forgive his son than reconsider the harsh sentences handed to non-violent offenders from the Capitol protests.\nBiden tried to justify the pardon, blaming “raw politics” for what he called a “miscarriage of justice” against Hunter. He claimed his son was unfairly targeted, but conveniently omitted the fact that Hunter had already pleaded guilty to tax evasion and was convicted on gun charges.\nSentencing was right around the corner—until Dad swooped in with his pen. And just for good measure, the pardon covers the next ten years of any potential Hunter-related crimes. Talk about a safety net.\nTwo Systems of Justice\nThe double standard is glaring. While Biden defends his son, many of Trump’s supporters are still languishing in prison for trespassing or other non-violent offenses from January 6, 2020.\nMeanwhile, others have pointed out the lack of consequences for Black Lives Matter and Antifa rioters. Remember when federal buildings were torched during the summer of 2020? Billions of dollars in damages, and most of those offenders didn’t even see a courtroom.\nYet, Biden had the audacity to claim that politics infected the justice system against his son. Funny, isn’t it? When rioters aligned with liberal causes break the law, they’re called “mostly peaceful protesters.”\nBut when middle-aged conservatives take selfies in the Capitol, they’re treated like the nation’s greatest threat. Sounds fair.\nRaw Politics or Raw Hypocrisy?\nBiden’s explanation for the pardon was soaked in sentimentality. “Here’s the truth,” he said. “I believe in the justice system, but… raw politics has infected this process.” Oh, really?\nThe same president who vowed not to interfere with the DOJ now wants us to believe that pardoning his son isn’t political? That’s like a bank robber saying they only took the money to save the economy.\nAccording to political commentator John Turley, this cements Biden’s legacy… but not in a good way.\nFrom Fox News:\nPresident Biden’s decision to use his presidential powers on Sunday to pardon his own son will be a decision that lives in infamy in presidential politics…\nEven among past controversies about the use of this pardon power, Biden has cemented his legacy for many, not as the commander in chief, but as the liar in chief.\nThe Bigger Picture\nThis isn’t just about Hunter Biden. It’s about trust in our institutions. When Americans see politicians bending the rules for their family or allies, it erodes faith in the justice system.\nBiden’s decision doesn’t just affect Hunter; it affects everyone who hoped this administration would live up to its promises of fairness and accountability. Spoiler alert: it didn’t.\nKey Takeaways\nBiden’s Broken Promise: After years of saying he wouldn’t pardon Hunter, Biden did exactly that, undermining his word.\nDouble Standards: Democrats seem to get a pass while conservatives face the full weight of the law.\nTrump’s Point: While Biden shields Hunter, Trump pledges to pardon non-violent January 6 offenders if re-elected.",

         "Independent Journalism Is Dying\nEver since President Trump’s miraculous victory, we’ve heard an incessant drumbeat about how legacy media is dying. This is true. The people have awakened to the reality that they’re being lied to by the self-proclaimed “Arbiters of Truth” for the sake of political expediency, corporate self-protection, and globalist ambitions.\nBut even as independent journalism rises to fill the void left by legacy media, there is still a huge challenge. Those at the top of independent media like Joe Rogan, Dan Bongino, and Tucker Carlson are thriving and rightly so. They have earned their audience and the financial rewards that come from it. They’ve taken risks and worked hard to get to where they are.\nFor “the rest of us,” legacy media and their proxies are making it exceptionally difficult to survive, let alone thrive. They still have a stranglehold over the “fact checkers” who have a dramatic impact on readership and viewership. YouTube, Facebook, and Google still stifle us. The freer speech platforms like Rumble and 𝕏 can only reward so many of their popular content creators. For independent journalists on the outside looking in, our only recourse is to rely on affiliates and sponsors.\nBut even as it seems nearly impossible to make a living, there are blessings that should not be disregarded. By highlighting strong sponsors who share our America First worldview, we have been able to make lifelong connections and even a bit of revenue to help us along. This is why we enjoy symbiotic relationships with companies like MyPillow, Jase Medical, and Promised Grounds. We help them with our recommendations and they reward us with money when our audience buys from them.\nThe same can be said about our preparedness sponsor, Prepper All-Naturals. Their long-term storage beef has a 25-year shelf life and is made with one ingredient: All-American Beef.\nEven our faith-driven precious metals sponsor helps us tremendously while also helping Americans protect their life’s savings. We are blessed to work with them.\nIndependent media is the future. In many ways, that future is already here. While the phrase, “the more the merrier,” does not apply to this business because there are still some bad actors in the independent media field, there are many great ones that do not get nearly enough attention. We hope to change that one content creator at a time.\nThank you and God Bless,\nJD Rucker",

         "By Lauren Victoria Burke, NNPA Newswire Contributor\nBaseball Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, who is Major League Baseball’s stolen bases leader and the all-time leadoff leader, has died at age 65. Henderson’s death came as a shock to many and several readers of online media expressed disbelief at the news. Henderson’s death was confirmed by his family on Dec. 1.\nRickey Henderson played for nine teams, including the Oakland As, the New York Mets and the New York Yankees. His career spanned 25-years, mostly with the Oakland A’s. Henderson was a 10-time All-Star and American League MVP in 1990. Henderson remains baseball’s greatest stealer of bases and was dubbed the “Man of Steal” during his playing time. Henderson stole 1,406 bases during his MLB career.\nHenderson’s stolen base record still stands and surpasses the next in line by 468 stolen bases. Lou Brock is the next closest all-time base stealer at 938 stolen bases.\n“Rickey Henderson is one of the greatest players of all time,” said ESPN’s Tim Kurkjian shortly after news of Henderson’s passing.\n“He is the greatest leadoff hitter of all time. He’s one of the greatest three left fielders of all time. He led the major leagues in history in runs scored and he scored 468 more bases than the next most in the history of Major League Baseball, Kurkjian remarked.\nHenderson was widely known as a showman and a colorful character. Because he played for so many teams and had the ability to change the entire complexion of a game, many of his former teammates reacted with sadness to news of his death.\n“Rickey Henderson was a dream to hit behind as teammate and a nightmare for a catcher as an opponent. He was one of the most generous, hysterical and gracious human beings… He will be sorely missed.. Prayers for his soul and family,” wrote former Mets catcher Mike Piazza.\n“Rickey Henderson was more than just one of the greatest baseball players of all-time. He was a loving father. Sending my sincere condolences to his family,” wrote former Major League pitcher John Rocker.\n“Rickey was simply the best player I ever played with. He could change the outcome of a game in so many ways. It puts a smile on my face just thinking about him. I will miss my friend,” said longtime Yankee Don Mattingly. Mattingly and Henderson played together for the New York Yankees from 1985-89.\nA statement from the New York Yankees read, “Rickey Henderson was an all-time great player who commanded our attention like few players before or since, transcending our traditional understanding of how elite and thrilling a single player could be in the batter’s box and on the basepaths. When he stepped across the white lines, he was magnetic. Opponents, teammates and fans simply couldn’t take their eyes off him. Though he spent just four and a half seasons in pinstripes, Rickey left an indelible mark on our record book, and he entertained us not only with his baseball talent, but with a no-nonsense personality and knack for showmanship that was ahead of its time.”\nRickey Henderson was born in 1958 in Chicago but grew up in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, with his grandmother. The cause of his death has not been announced by his family.\nHenderson died in California. He is survived by his wife Pamela and his three daughters Angela, Adrianna, and Alexis.",

         "Donald Trump said both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him on Wednesday, and Trump ordered top U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the war in Ukraine.\nThe conversations came after Trump’s defense secretary earlier said Kyiv would have to give up its long-held goals of joining the NATO military alliance and regaining all of its territory seized by Russia, signaling a dramatic shift in Washington’s approach to the conflict.\nAfter speaking with Putin for more than an hour, Trump said the Russian leader, who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wants the war to end and they discussed “getting a ceasefire in the not-too-distant future.”\n“He wants it to end. He doesn’t want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n“I think we’re on the way to getting peace. I think President Putin wants peace, President Zelenskyy wants peace and I want peace. I just want to see people stop getting killed,” he added.\nTrump has long said he would quickly end the war in Ukraine, without spelling out exactly how he would accomplish this.\nThe Kremlin earlier said Putin and Trump had agreed to meet, and Putin had invited Trump to visit Moscow. Trump said their first meeting would “probably” take place soon in Saudi Arabia.\nIn a post on his social media platform, he said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would lead negotiations on ending the war.\nTrump and Zelenskyy spoke after Trump’s call with Putin, and Zelenskyy’s office said the conversation lasted for about an hour.\n“I had a meaningful conversation with @POTUS. We… talked about opportunities to achieve peace, discussed our readiness to work together …and Ukraine’s technological capabilities… including drones and other advanced industries,” Zelenskyy wrote on X.\nNo Ukraine peace talks have been held since the early months of the conflict, now approaching its third anniversary. Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, oversaw billions of dollars of military and other aid to Kyiv and had no direct contact with Putin after Russia’s invasion.\nRussia occupies around a fifth of Ukraine and has demanded Kyiv cede more territory and be rendered permanently neutral under any peace deal.\nUkraine demands Russia withdraw from captured territory and says it must receive NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent Moscow from attacking again.\nEuropean powers, including Britain, France and Germany, said on Wednesday they had to be part of any future negotiations on the fate of Ukraine, underscoring that only a fair accord with security guarantees would ensure lasting peace. They said they were ready to enhance support for Ukraine and put it in a position of strength.\n‘Illusionary goal’\nEarlier on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered the new administration’s bluntest statement so far on its approach to the war, saying Kyiv could not realistically hope to return to previous borders or join NATO.\n“We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth told a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels. “Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.”\nRussia in 2014 annexed Crimea, which Ukraine and many Western countries consider to be occupied Ukrainian territory.\nHegseth said any durable peace must include “robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again”. But he said U.S. troops would not be deployed to Ukraine as part of such guarantees.\nZelenskyy, hoping to keep Trump interested in continuing to support his country, has lately proposed a deal under which the United States would invest in minerals in Ukraine.\nTrump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in Kyiv on Wednesday on the first visit by a member of Trump’s cabinet, said such a mineral deal could serve as a “security shield” for Ukraine after the war.\nTrump also said Rubio and Vice President JD Vance will hold talks about the war on Friday in Munich, where Ukrainian officials were expected to attend an annual security conference.\nThe new diplomacy followed a U.S.-Russia prisoner swap that got under way on Tuesday, which the Kremlin said could help build trust between the two countries.\nRussia on Tuesday freed American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who was serving a 14-year sentence in a Russian prison, in exchange for a Russian cybercrime boss imprisoned in the U.S., according to a official.",

         "An executive order President Donald Trump signed on his first day back in office offers a new federal government definition of the sexes that could have a major impact on transgender people nationwide.\nThe order calls for the federal government to define sex as only male or female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and policies such as federal prison assignments. As for federal spending, it’s not clear what his vow to end broader gender classifications will mean on the ground.\nMany of the provisions are likely to be challenged in court.\nHere’s a look at the order.\nDefining male and female based on cells that don’t exist at conception\nThe order declares that there are just two sexes, male and female. It rejects that people can transition from one gender to another or be considered something other than male or female such as nonbinary, which describes people who don’t identify as strictly men or women, or intersex.\nThe position reflects what many social conservatives have called for — and conflicts with what the American Medical Association and other mainstream medical groups say: that extensive scientific research suggests sex and gender are better understood as a spectrum than as an either-or definition.\nTrump’s order says it is intended to protect women’s spaces from those who “self-identify” as women.\nIt defines the sexes in an unconventional way, based on the reproductive cells — large cells in females or small ones in males. And it suggests that humans have those cells at conception.\nBiologists say that’s a problem because egg cells develop many weeks later, and sperm cells are produced at puberty, not at conception.\n“At that stage, sexual differentiation has not started to take place,” said Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington evolutionary biologist. “I can’t see any logically coherent way to interpret the definition in this executive order, given the addition of the phrase ‘at conception.’”\nBergstrom said a scientific explanation could specify sex chromosomes, but the executive order seems to deliberately avoid that, presumably to sidestep the range of variations that include intersex people, who have physical traits that don’t fit typical definitions for male or female categories.\nWhat parts of the order are in effect?\nThe order has been signed, but much of it requires more federal action.\n“Nothing is in effect,” said Heron Greenesmith, deputy director of policy at the Transgender Law Center.\nThe executive order tells one White House staff member to draft a bill for Congress within 30 days that would codify the definitions into law.\nFederal agencies must tell the president within 120 days what they’ve done to comply with the order. Some parts might require going through the regulatory process or passing new laws.\nOmar Gonzalez-Pagan, a Lambda Legal lawyer, said on a call with journalists this week that the order does not change current law but rather creates “a clear signal and road map of where this administration’s policies lie when it comes to transgender people.”\nState laws on participation in sports, bathroom use, gender-affirming care and other issues are not directly affected.\nWhat does it mean for federally issued documents?\nThe order calls for passports, visas and Global Entry cards to reflect the administration’s definition of sexes.\nThe State Department, which is responsible for passports, declined to answer questions about the current state of policy. The order suggests getting rid of the “X” designation that has been available on passports since 2021 after a long legal battle waged by an intersex activist.\nA department webpage that described how people could change their gender marker was taken offline, and Chase Strangio, an ACLU lawyer, said it’s unlikely that any new application to change the gender marker on a passport will be approved.\nA White House spokesperson told the news outlet NOTUS this week that passports that have not expired will remain valid. But people will have to comply with the new order when they apply for a new passport or renew an old one.\nWhat about transgender federal prison inmates?\nThe order contains specific details on how it should apply in federal prisons, which house nearly 2,300 transgender inmates — about 1.5% of the total population.\nIt calls for housing transgender women — there are more than 1,500 — in men’s prisons, and for halting gender-affirming medical care.\nAt least two transgender inmates have had government-funded gender-affirming surgery in recent years as a result of court orders. A larger number have received other treatment, such as hormones.\nSarah Warbelow, legal director at Human Rights Campaign, said court orders that grant inmates access to treatment remain in effect, even if federal policy changes.\nThe ACLU says it’s heard from some defense lawyers that incarcerated transgender women were being moved into isolation or being told they would be transferred to men’s prisons.\nThe Bureau of Prisons did not respond to questions about whether inmates are to be moved.\nWill this stop Medicaid from paying for gender-affirming care?\nMedicaid, a joint federal-state health insurance program for lower-income people, covers gender-affirming care in some states.\nFormer President Joe Biden’s administration adopted a rule to make it do so nationally. But judges put that on hold.\nSo far, it’s unclear what might happen to the coverage in states that chose to offer it.\nLindsey Dawson, director of LGBTQ health policy at the health policy research organization KFF, said that eliminating the coverage where it’s already in place would likely involve a long process — and, like others, would probably face court challenges.",

         "CHICAGO (CBS) -- Chicago native and former Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls guard Dwyane Wade revealed Thursday that he was diagnosed with cancer a little over a year ago and lost part of his kidney as a result.\nOn his \"The WY Network\" podcast, Wade, 43, said post-retirement from the NBA, he was no longer getting regular physicals as he had in his playing days.\nBut Wade's father had battled prostate cancer, so Wade said on the podcast that he decided go for a checkup and asked the doctor to investigate everything he was feeling and experiencing — in particular slow and weak urination.\n\"Because I did the full-body scan, they were able to see my entire body, my entire inside, and they were able to see something that was on my kidney — on my right kidney,\" Wade said on the podcast.\nWade also found out he needed to have kidney surgery. He went in for the surgery on Dec. 18, 2023, and found out that the tumor was indeed cancerous.\nHe had 40% of his right kidney removed in the surgery — and he said on the podcast that it was a challenge for him in many ways.\n\"My own journey to have that surgery, I think it was the first time my family — my dad, my kids — they saw me weak,\" Wade said. \"That moment was probably the weakest one I've ever felt in my life.\"\nBut he said he has been making a point of living differently and to the fullest ever since. Wade also emphasized the need for men in particular to check in and take time out for themselves with regard to health.\nWade is a native of Chicago's South Side. His childhood home was at 59th Street and Prairie Avenue in the Washington Park neighborhood. He and his family later lived in south suburban Robbins.\nWade put Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn on the basketball map, winning a pair of conference titles, and went on to Marquette University in Milwaukee — where he took the Marquette Golden Eagles to the NCAA Final Four in 2003.\nHe was drafted by the Miami Heat that same year as the fifth overall pick, and played with the Heat for 13 straight seasons — winning NBA titles with the team.\nWade was signed to the Bulls for a two-year deal in 2016, but only played in his hometown for one. He negotiated a contract buyout the following year and moved to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nWade returned to the Heat in 2018 and finished his playing career in Miami.",
