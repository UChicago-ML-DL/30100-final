We're actually going to claim less spending reductions because we're going to claim the real spending reductions, not the fake spending reductions.\"",

Small businesses , who get government relief money are expected to rehire workers , are unsure when the business will reopen and how it will operate . ( AP Photo/Charles Krupa )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — Some small businesses that obtained a highly-coveted government loan say they won ’ t be able to use it to bring all their laid-off workers back , even though that is what the program was designed to do .\nThe Paycheck Protection Program promises a business owner loan forgiveness if they retain or rehire all the workers they had in late February . But owners say the equation isn ’ t so simple , in part because of current economic conditions and partly due to the terms of the loans .\nAs a result , the lending may not reduce unemployment as much as the Trump administration and Congress hope .\nThe government ’ s $ 2 trillion relief package included $ 349 billion for the small business loan program , which was besieged with applications and ran out of money Thursday . Congress and the White House reached a deal Tuesday that would provide another $ 310 billion .\nTo get the loans forgiven , companies need to spend 75 % on payroll within eight weeks of receiving the money . The other 25 % can be spent on rent , utilities , and mortgage payments . Otherwise , the loan has generous terms : Only a 1 % interest rate and six months before any principal is due .\nMany of the small companies that were able to obtain a loan are having second thoughts about rehiring all their workers and a few plan to return the money . Others will use what they can on rent and utilities , and will use some to rehire a portion of their laid-off staff . But most are unsure they will be able to reopen eight weeks from now . They see little point in rehiring all their workers , paying them to do little or nothing , and then potentially laying them off again if business remains weak two months from now .\n“ You ’ re turning the business into a pass through for the federal government , ” said Joe Walsh , who owns Clean Green Maine , a cleaning service in Portland , Maine with 35 employees . “ You ’ re doing very little to actually help the business . ”\nIt ’ s unclear how much the small business lending program can hold back the surge in joblessness — a record 22 million people sought unemployment aid in the past month . Most economists forecast the unemployment rate will reach between 15 % and 20 % when the monthly jobs report is released in early May .\nMore money is clearly needed : Roughly 1.6 million small companies were able to obtain loans , the Small Business Administration said , out of at least 6 million that were likely eligible , according to Census data . Bank of America economists estimate that another $ 650 billion would be necessary to meet demand .\nAlso , the generous unemployment aid that was also included in the government ’ s relief package has made it more difficult to rehire . Many workers are making more with unemployment checks , which now include a $ 600 weekly benefit from the federal government .\nWalsh , who received a $ 280,000 loan from the SBA , said that he is reluctant to push his employees to return to work because , under unemployment benefit rules , they could lose their weekly checks if they turn down potential jobs .\n“ That ’ s just putting me as the employer in a really difficult position , ” Walsh said . He pays at least $ 17 an hour , with benefits , but his former employees are getting the equivalent of roughly $ 25 an hour from unemployment .\nRight now , Walsh ’ s business is closed due to lack of demand for cleaning services . He hopes to reopen soon and bring back some workers , retrain them on new sanitizing processes , and earn a bit of revenue . Still , he doubts his business will be anywhere close to what it was anytime soon , which means his workforce won ’ t be either .\n“ There ’ s no way that I ’ m getting to 100 % employment by the end of 8 weeks , ” he said .\nThe National Federation for Independent Business , a small business advocacy group , is pushing the government to make it easier for loans to be forgiven .\nThe group wants the SBA to eliminate the requirement that 75 % be spent on payroll , or at least reduce it to 50 % . It also wants the rehiring window extended beyond eight weeks and is pushing for a “ good faith ” provision that would credit companies for trying to rehire workers who prefer unemployment aid instead .\nThe NFIB also asked that half the next round of funding be reserved for businesses with fewer than 20 employees , to counter complaints that many large , publicly-traded companies obtained loans in the first round . The agreement reached late Tuesday did not make that change but directed some funds to smaller banks .\nAccording to a survey of its members , the NFIB said that just half of those who have applied for loans expect that they will rehire all their workers and get the entire amount forgiven .

Small businesses, who get government relief money are expected to rehire workers, are unsure when the business will reopen and how it will operate. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Some small businesses that obtained a highly-coveted government loan say they won’t be able to use it to bring all their laid-off workers back, even though that is what the program was designed to do.\n\nThe Paycheck Protection Program promises a business owner loan forgiveness if they retain or rehire all the workers they had in late February. But owners say the equation isn’t so simple, in part because of current economic conditions and partly due to the terms of the loans.\n\nAs a result, the lending may not reduce unemployment as much as the Trump administration and Congress hope.\n\nThe government’s $2 trillion relief package included $349 billion for the small business loan program, which was besieged with applications and ran out of money Thursday . Congress and the White House reached a deal Tuesday that would provide another $310 billion.\n\nTo get the loans forgiven, companies need to spend 75% on payroll within eight weeks of receiving the money. The other 25% can be spent on rent, utilities, and mortgage payments. Otherwise, the loan has generous terms: Only a 1% interest rate and six months before any principal is due.\n\nMany of the small companies that were able to obtain a loan are having second thoughts about rehiring all their workers and a few plan to return the money. Others will use what they can on rent and utilities, and will use some to rehire a portion of their laid-off staff. But most are unsure they will be able to reopen eight weeks from now. They see little point in rehiring all their workers, paying them to do little or nothing, and then potentially laying them off again if business remains weak two months from now.\n\n“You’re turning the business into a pass through for the federal government,” said Joe Walsh, who owns Clean Green Maine, a cleaning service in Portland, Maine with 35 employees. “You’re doing very little to actually help the business.”\n\nIt’s unclear how much the small business lending program can hold back the surge in joblessness — a record 22 million people sought unemployment aid in the past month. Most economists forecast the unemployment rate will reach between 15% and 20% when the monthly jobs report is released in early May.\n\nMore money is clearly needed: Roughly 1.6 million small companies were able to obtain loans, the Small Business Administration said, out of at least 6 million that were likely eligible, according to Census data. Bank of America economists estimate that another $650 billion would be necessary to meet demand.\n\nAlso, the generous unemployment aid that was also included in the government’s relief package has made it more difficult to rehire. Many workers are making more with unemployment checks, which now include a $600 weekly benefit from the federal government.\n\nWalsh, who received a $280,000 loan from the SBA, said that he is reluctant to push his employees to return to work because, under unemployment benefit rules, they could lose their weekly checks if they turn down potential jobs.\n\n“That’s just putting me as the employer in a really difficult position,” Walsh said. He pays at least $17 an hour, with benefits, but his former employees are getting the equivalent of roughly $25 an hour from unemployment.\n\nRight now, Walsh’s business is closed due to lack of demand for cleaning services. He hopes to reopen soon and bring back some workers, retrain them on new sanitizing processes, and earn a bit of revenue. Still, he doubts his business will be anywhere close to what it was anytime soon, which means his workforce won’t be either.\n\n“There’s no way that I’m getting to 100% employment by the end of 8 weeks,” he said.\n\nThe National Federation for Independent Business, a small business advocacy group, is pushing the government to make it easier for loans to be forgiven.\n\nThe group wants the SBA to eliminate the requirement that 75% be spent on payroll, or at least reduce it to 50%. It also wants the rehiring window extended beyond eight weeks and is pushing for a “good faith” provision that would credit companies for trying to rehire workers who prefer unemployment aid instead.\n\nThe NFIB also asked that half the next round of funding be reserved for businesses with fewer than 20 employees, to counter complaints that many large, publicly-traded companies obtained loans in the first round. The agreement reached late Tuesday did not make that change but directed some funds to smaller banks.\n\nAccording to a survey of its members, the NFIB said that just half of those who have applied for loans expect that they will rehire all their workers and get the entire amount forgiven. A quarter expect that at least three-quarters of the loan will be forgiven, while 15% didn’t know.\n\nThe American Sustainable Business Council and several other small business groups are pushing to have the starting date for rehiring shifted from the date a company received a loan to the date it can legally reopen. Many restaurants, gyms, and movie theaters have been shut down by the state.\n\nAdam Rammel received a $160,000 loan for his restaurant and bar in Bellefontaine, Ohio, near Columbus, though he’s uncertain about how many of his 17 laid-off staffers he will be able to rehire and when.

A federal judge has held DeVos in contempt of court for violating an order to stop collecting loans from thousands of former for-profit college students . ( AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was held in contempt of court after a federal judge said she violated an earlier order to stop collecting loans from former students of a defunct for-profit college chain .\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim issued the ruling Thursday in San Francisco , saying DeVos and the department made “ only minimal efforts ” to comply with a 2018 court order . Kim also fined the Education Department $ 100,000 and required the agency to make monthly reports to prove it is complying with the order .\nThe dispute stems from a lawsuit filed by thousands of former Corinthian Colleges students who say they were defrauded by the chain before it collapsed in 2015 . The suit says the students are owed full forgiveness of their federal student loans under a rule created by the Obama administration , and it challenges DeVos ’ 2017 decision to provide only partial relief based on borrowers ’ incomes .\nIn a May 2018 decision , Kim ruled that the partial-relief formula was unlawful .

A federal judge has held DeVos in contempt of court for violating an order to stop collecting loans from thousands of former for-profit college students. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was held in contempt of court after a federal judge said she violated an earlier order to stop collecting loans from former students of a defunct for-profit college chain.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim issued the ruling Thursday in San Francisco, saying DeVos and the department made “only minimal efforts” to comply with a 2018 court order. Kim also fined the Education Department $100,000 and required the agency to make monthly reports to prove it is complying with the order.\n\nThe dispute stems from a lawsuit filed by thousands of former Corinthian Colleges students who say they were defrauded by the chain before it collapsed in 2015. The suit says the students are owed full forgiveness of their federal student loans under a rule created by the Obama administration, and it challenges DeVos’ 2017 decision to provide only partial relief based on borrowers’ incomes.\n\nIn a May 2018 decision, Kim ruled that the partial-relief formula was unlawful. She ordered the department to stop using the formula and to stop collecting student loans from former Corinthian students.\n\nBut in a September court filing, the department acknowledged that it incorrectly sent loan bills to more than 16,000 former Corinthian students, prompting more than 3,000 to send payments. The department also garnished wages or tax refunds from 1,800 borrowers and provided credit agencies with negative reports about 800 borrowers.\n\nThe judge wrote that there was “no question” the department and DeVos violated the May 2018 injunction. She said the defendants had “not provided evidence that they were unable to comply with the preliminary injunction, and the evidence shows only minimal efforts to comply with the preliminary injunction.”\n\nThe Education Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLawyers for the former Corinthian students called the ruling a “rare and powerful action” that provides consequences for the “extreme harm” DeVos caused.\n\nDeVos “repeatedly and brazenly violated the law to collect for-profit college students’ debts and deny their rights, and today she has been held accountable,” said Toby Merrill, director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending, which helped file the suit. “The judge is sending a loud and clear message: Students have rights under the law, and DeVos’ illegal and reckless violation of their rights will not be tolerated.”\n\nIn her ruling, the judge said the department sent just a single, three-sentence email with instructions to loan servicers, along with an “equally cursory” email to certain borrowers. There were no meetings or phone calls, Kim wrote, and little effort to make sure loan servicers received the emails.\n\nThe judge threatened to impose further sanctions if the department fails to follow her order, saying she would appoint a court official to serve as “special master” to help enforce the injunction.\n\nThe $100,000 fine will repay students for expenses they incurred to raise the issue to the court.

         "I can not wait to learn more about the identity and motives of the secret whistleblower who figures so prominently in stories of Trump ’ s phone call with the newly elected Ukrainian president . The narrative that began a month ago , as an insider ’ s accusation of Trump ’ s threat to cut off U.S. military aid unless investigations were launched into his expected opponent Joe Biden , has evolved considerably .\nIt now appears — in spite of initial denials — that the whistleblower consulted with House Intelligence Committee ( HIC ) staff before filing his complaint — and was advised immediately to obtain counsel . Somehow , the chosen counsel was part of a whistleblower search organization , whose staff had previously worked with HIC chairman Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) . While the whistleblower ’ s complaint was based entirely on secondhand hearsay — which was explicitly precluded under existing reporting rules — those rules were changed after the complaint ’ s receipt so as to do away with the requirement of firsthand knowledge .\nWhat began as an admission that the whistleblower worked for the CIA and was a registered Democrat was accompanied by the absolute assurance that he was not an active partisan and had not worked in any current presidential campaign . That assurance now seems to be evolving into a situation in which the whistleblower had been assigned to the National Security Council , where he worked with former Vice President Biden — and may even have traveled with him on one or more trips to Ukraine .\nWords are being chosen quite carefully , and the truth seems more and more elusive , as Republican HIC members continue to be kept in the dark . One is reminded of Lewis Carroll ’ s Alice in Wonderland , in which Alice exclaims , “ Curiouser and curiouser ! ”\nWhile the mainstream media continues to provide breathless coverage as events unfold , they evidence a strong disinclination to ferret out more information regarding the whistleblower ’ s actual identity or motives in coming forward — almost relishing the idea that HIC hearings can feature his testimony ( whether he is actually present or not ) without his identity ever becoming known .\nThe obvious parallel is to “ Deep Throat , ” Woodward and Bernstein ’ s alleged secret source for many of their Watergate revelations , whose identity remained not only secret but also an integral part of Georgetown cocktail conversation for the next 30 years .\nFor those not living through the halcyon days of Watergate , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein became famous for their series of revelations regarding the status of prosecutors ’ ongoing Watergate investigations , but it was not until their 1974 book , All the President ’ s Men , that they credited a secret source they claimed to have referred to as “ Deep Throat , ” after a popular pornographic movie character . The more recent backstory is that their publisher at Simon & Schuster had encouraged them to add more drama to their proposed book , which is how the term first came into being . In short , Deep Throat was not a term used in print or even newsroom discussions before it first appeared in their book — as their calculatedly mysterious source .\nRegardless , speculation about just who Deep Throat might be was a dominant feature of Washington gossip for the ensuing decades . Possible candidates were inevitably confined to those who had served on President Nixon ’ s White House staff , including his Chief of Staff Alexander Haig , one of his many lawyers ( John Dean , Fred Fielding , Len Garment , or Fred Buzhardt ) , one of his speechwriters ( Bill Safire , David Gergen , or Ben Stein ) , or one of other young White House aides ( including Diane Sawyer , Jonathan Rose , or Jeff Donfeld ) . Even Henry Kissinger ’ s name occasionally surfaced in the unending speculation .\nThe common theme was that Deep Throat had become so disgusted with Nixon ’ s conduct that the need to reveal the wrongdoing far outweighed any idea of loyalty to the president . This was in spite of the fact that my boss and Nixon ’ s lead Watergate defense counsel thought at the time that the leaks were coming from Mark Felt at the FBI . This belief was accompanied by the recognition that we weren ’ t in a position to do much about it , since pressuring Felt might result in even more leaks . In fact , there is a humorous conversation on the White House tapes in which Haig suggests to Nixon that Felt is the one doing the leaking — and characterizes him as “ the white rat. ” Haig goes on to explain that ’ s what Felt is called behind his back at the Bureau : He has a long face and a rather sallow complexion . “ Well , Mr. President , he looks like a rat , ” is how Haig finally sums it up .\nFor decades afterwards , when I would mention that I had worked on Nixon ’ s White House staff , people would inevitably ask if I knew who Deep Throat was . When I answered in the affirmative , they would get all excited — until I said it was Mark Felt , the white rat . Then , since this obviously was not some famous name from Nixon ’ s own White House , their interest would wane and the conversation would move on .\nWhen Felt ’ s daughter claimed he was Deep Throat in 2005 and Woodward and Bernstein rushed out a book , The Secret Man : The Story of Watergate ’ s Deep Throat , supposedly confirming it , everyone accepted it at face value . For his part , Felt was way too senile to provide any real confirmation . More significantly , it turned out that Felt had no animosity toward President Nixon ; his leaks were designed to show that Acting FBI Director Patrick Gray couldn ’ t control the FBI and should be replaced by then–Deputy Director Felt .\nWhy , then , had all of the media been so certain for the prior three decades that Deep Throat simply had to be a disillusioned Nixon White House staffer ? Following Felt ’ s 2005 outing , I went back and re-read All the President ’ s Men and then compared the book to the subsequent movie version — only to discover tantalizing differences in Deep Throat ’ s treatment .\nIn their book , there is no implication whatsoever that Deep Throat is a White House employee . The authors were very careful not to give any hint at all as to his place of employment . The movie version , however , differs considerably — with implied White House employment occurring in three separate scenes : First , relatively early on , Woodward ( played by Robert Redford ) and Bernstein ( played by Dustin Hoffman ) are shown on the Library of Congress steps , lamenting that they are out of leads . Redford offers up the idea that he has a contact at the Nixon White House — and their paucity of leads quickly evaporates . Second , at one point , Redford calls Deep Throat ( played by Hal Holbrook ) at work . In the movie scene , Redford is shown in a public phone booth ( remember those ? ) located on the sidewalk across the street from the Old Executive Office Building — an integral part of the White House compound — which he stares at while speaking to Holbrook , who instructs him never again to call him at work . Third , when Holbrook departs from his office on his way to deliver secret papers in a nighttime rendezvous , he is shown as driving out of the White House ’ s Northwest Gate .\nThe result was the unspoken assurance of Deep Throat being a White House staffer . The movie audience , after all , saw this with their own eyes !\nSeveral other Deep Throat observations : By far the best description of Deep Throat and his activities is Max Holland ’ s Leak : Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat ( 2012 ) , supplemented by Holland ’ s extensive critical review of the 2017 film Mark Felt .

In an unpublished interview cited by Jeff Himmelman in Yours in Truth : A Personal Portrait of Ben Bradlee , Legendary Editor of The Washington Post ( 2012 ) , Bradlee expressed his own doubts as to the authenticity of the Deep Throat story :\nYou know I have a little problem with Deep Throat.… Did that potted [ plant ] incident ever happen ? … and meeting in some garage .

         "The New York Times has decided to blame the El Paso murders not on the actual killer but on “ conservative media stars. ” As here .\nSpecifically , by name , that would be the Fox News evening lineup of Tucker Carlson , Sean Hannity , and Laura Ingraham . Then it goes on to talk radio ’ s Rush Limbaugh , plus Fox and Friends ’ Brian Kilmeade , Fox ’ s Jeanine Pirro , and Ann Coulter . Thrown in along the way were “ outlets like Sinclair Broadcast Group and The Drudge Report to platforms like Breitbart News and Gateway Pundit , ” with a specific mention of Sinclair ’ s Boris Epshteyn . And oh yes , there was a reference to former Nixon and Reagan aide and columnist Pat Buchanan .\nSuffice to say , the smear instantly backfired on the Times itself . Big time .\nThere is a striking degree of overlap between the words of right-wing media personalities and the language used by the Texas man who confessed to killing 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso this month . In a 2,300-word screed posted on the website 8chan , the killer wrote that he was “ simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion . ”\nGot that ? There was a “ striking degree of overlap ” between the language of these conservative media stars and “ the language used by ” the El Paso killer in his so-called “ manifesto . ”\nWell , now . What did the Times story mysteriously leave out ? This .\nTo borrow from the Times , “ There is a striking degree of overlap between the words of left-wing Democratic presidential candidates and the New York Times and the language used by ” the Texas shooter .\nThe inconvenient truth is that our leaders , both Democrat AND Republican , have been failing us for decades . They are either complacent or involved in one of the biggest betrayals of the American public in our history . The takeover of the United States government by unchecked corporations .\nWhere would the killer get such an idea ? Where would he pick up such anti-corporate language ?\nHe could start by reading this November 25 , 2018 column by New York Times opinion columnist David Leonhardt titled :\nThe Monopolization of America In one industry after another , big companies have become more dominant over the past 15 years , new data show .\nIn which the Times columnist says this ( bold print supplied ) :\nHostility to corporate bigness animated Thomas Jefferson and Teddy Roosevelt , as well as the labor movement , Granger movement , Progressive movement and more . Of course , monopolies and other corporate giants have fought back against these assaults on their power , and sometimes succeeded for years or decades at a time . It happened during the age of Rockefeller and Morgan . Over the past 40 years , it has happened again . The federal government , under presidents of both parties , has largely surrendered to monopoly power . “ The ‘ anti ’ in ‘ antitrust ’ has been discarded , ” as the legal scholar Tim Wu puts it in his new book , “ The Curse of Bigness. ” Washington allows most megamergers to proceed either straight up or with only fig-leaf changes . The government has also done nothing to prevent the emergence of dominant new technology companies that mimic the old AT & T monopoly .\nThen there was this language by another Times columnist , Farhad Manjoo , assailing five specific corporations :\nIn which Manjoo says this of big corporations “ Amazon , Apple , Facebook , Microsoft and Alphabet , the parent company of Google ” :\nThis is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism : We are , all of us , in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy .\nManjoo closes by saying this of the dominance by these five giant corporations : “ It ’ s too late to escape . ”\nNot to be left out is this Times jewel assailing corporations , this one written by Steven Davidoff Solomon , identified as “ a professor of law at the University of California , Berkeley. ” The Times published Professor Solomon as saying this of big corporations and their use of “ corporate inversions ” :\nIf you thought there was a problem with inversions — deals that allow American companies to relocate their headquarters to lower their tax bills — wait until you hear about the real secret to avoiding corporate taxes . It ’ s called earnings stripping , and it is a technique that the Obama administration has so far failed to stop . The public outcry over the use of inversions is now entering its third year . Pfizer is trying the biggest one yet , a $ 152 billion deal for Allergan , the maker of Botox , which is based in Dublin . The flight of American icons like Pfizer has led to complaints that corporations are gaming the system to lower the taxes they pay to Washington . At the same time , the companies stay in the United States , getting all the benefits of our country .\nOne could go on and on with examples of New York Times language assailing the power of corporations , their evasions of taxes , and more . Language that matches exactly the language of the El Paso shooter . But let ’ s move on to Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .\nWarren , it turns out , had a fan in the Dayton , Ohio , shooter . And Warren ’ s language on corporations and their power couldn ’ t be missed . Examples ?\nHere is the Atlantic running a piece on Warren ’ s views on corporate power as written by Stacy Mitchell , “ Co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. ” The headline :\nThe Atlantic story says that Warren believes “ that big corporations ’ political influence and market dominance are killing smaller rivals , and that small-business owners share interests with other victims of corporate power . ”\nReplying to Mitt Romney ’ s statement in 2008 that “ corporations are people , ” Warren said :\nNo , Governor Romney , corporations are not people . People have hearts , they have kids , they get jobs , they get sick , they love , and they die . And that matters . That matter because we don ’ t run this country for corporations , we run it for people . People feel the system is rigged against them . And here ’ s the painful part . They ’ re right . The system is rigged . Look around . Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies . Wall Street CEOs — the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs — still strut around Congress , no shame , demanding favors , and acting like we should thank them .\nThere is infinitely more of Warren assailing corporate power , but let ’ s move to Bernie Sanders . Here is Sanders saying this on page 273 of his book Our Revolution :\nCorporate tax reform must start by preventing profitable companies from sheltering profits in tax haven countries like the Cayman Islands . In 2015 , I introduced legislation with Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois to do just that . The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would end the loophole that allows corporations to defer paying taxes on overseas profits . Instead , it would require corporations to pay U.S. taxes on offshore profits as they are earned . This bill would take away the tax incentives for corporations to shift profits and move jobs and factories offshore , by taxing their profits no matter where they are generated . American corporations would continue to get a credit against their U.S. tax liability for foreign taxes they pay , but they would have to pay the federal government the difference between the foreign rate and the U.S. rate .\nAlso in the Sanders book was this attack on corporations and their control of the media :\nIn 1983 the largest fifty corporations controlled 90 percent of the media . That ’ s a high level of concentration . Today , as a result of massive mergers and takeovers , six corporations control 90 percent of what we see , hear , and read . This is outrageous , and a real threat to our democracy .\nOn and on and on I could go with attacks on corporations and corporate power by the New York Times and Senators Warren and Sanders — not to mention other Democratic presidential candidates .\nThere is no question that in both exact language and certainly in sentiment the views repeatedly expressed by the Times , Warren , and Sanders matches exactly the language and sentiment of the El Paso killer on corporations and corporate power .\nSurprise ? In this not so-cleverly disguised attack on Tucker , Sean , Laura , Rush , and the rest , the Times mentions nary a peep of the similarity in language between the shooter ’ s “ manifesto ” and the Times itself , as well as Warren and Sanders . Say again : not … a … single … word .\nThe obvious conclusion ? The left-wing paper wanted to shift responsibility for the shooting from the shooter and blame the stars of conservative media .\nBut in playing this game the New York Times managed to hit a decidedly unintended target : the New York Times itself .",

Thrown in along the way were “outlets like Sinclair Broadcast Group and The Drudge Report to platforms like Breitbart News and Gateway Pundit,” with a specific mention of Sinclair’s Boris Epshteyn. And oh yes, there was a reference to former Nixon and Reagan aide and columnist Pat Buchanan.\n\nSuffice to say, the smear instantly backfired on the Times itself. Big time.\n\nLet’s start with the Times’ reasoning on this smear:\n\nThere is a striking degree of overlap between the words of right-wing media personalities and the language used by the Texas man who confessed to killing 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso this month. In a 2,300-word screed posted on the website 8chan, the killer wrote that he was “simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion.”\n\nGot that? There was a “striking degree of overlap” between the language of these conservative media stars and “the language used by” the El Paso killer in his so-called “manifesto.”\n\nWell, now. What did the Times story mysteriously leave out? This.\n\nTo borrow from the Times, “There is a striking degree of overlap between the words of left-wing Democratic presidential candidates and the New York Times and the language used by” the Texas shooter.\n\nLet’s get specific. Says the killer:\n\nThe inconvenient truth is that our leaders, both Democrat AND Republican, have been failing us for decades. They are either complacent or involved in one of the biggest betrayals of the American public in our history. The takeover of the United States government by unchecked corporations.\n\nWhere would the killer get such an idea? Where would he pick up such anti-corporate language?\n\nHe could start by reading this November 25, 2018 column by New York Times opinion columnist David Leonhardt titled:\n\nThe Monopolization of America In one industry after another, big companies have become more dominant over the past 15 years, new data show.\n\nIn which the Times columnist says this (bold print supplied):\n\nHostility to corporate bigness animated Thomas Jefferson and Teddy Roosevelt, as well as the labor movement, Granger movement, Progressive movement and more. Of course, monopolies and other corporate giants have fought back against these assaults on their power, and sometimes succeeded for years or decades at a time. It happened during the age of Rockefeller and Morgan. Over the past 40 years, it has happened again. The federal government, under presidents of both parties, has largely surrendered to monopoly power. “The ‘anti’ in ‘antitrust’ has been discarded,” as the legal scholar Tim Wu puts it in his new book, “The Curse of Bigness.” Washington allows most megamergers to proceed either straight up or with only fig-leaf changes. The government has also done nothing to prevent the emergence of dominant new technology companies that mimic the old AT&T monopoly.\n\nThen there was this language by another Times columnist, Farhad Manjoo, assailing five specific corporations:\n\nTech’s Frightful Five: They’ve Got Us\n\nIn which Manjoo says this of big corporations “Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google”:\n\nThis is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy.\n\nManjoo closes by saying this of the dominance by these five giant corporations: “It’s too late to escape.”\n\nNot to be left out is this Times jewel assailing corporations, this one written by Steven Davidoff Solomon, identified as “a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.” The Times published Professor Solomon as saying this of big corporations and their use of “corporate inversions”:\n\nIf you thought there was a problem with inversions — deals that allow American companies to relocate their headquarters to lower their tax bills — wait until you hear about the real secret to avoiding corporate taxes. It’s called earnings stripping, and it is a technique that the Obama administration has so far failed to stop. The public outcry over the use of inversions is now entering its third year. Pfizer is trying the biggest one yet, a $152 billion deal for Allergan, the maker of Botox, which is based in Dublin. The flight of American icons like Pfizer has led to complaints that corporations are gaming the system to lower the taxes they pay to Washington. At the same time, the companies stay in the United States, getting all the benefits of our country.\n\nOne could go on and on with examples of New York Times language assailing the power of corporations, their evasions of taxes, and more. Language that matches exactly the language of the El Paso shooter. But let’s move on to Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nWarren, it turns out, had a fan in the Dayton, Ohio, shooter. And Warren’s language on corporations and their power couldn’t be missed. Examples?\n\nHere is the Atlantic running a piece on Warren’s views on corporate power as written by Stacy Mitchell, “Co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.” The headline:\n\nElizabeth Warren Has a Theory About Corporate Power\n\nThe Atlantic story says that Warren believes “that big corporations’ political influence and market dominance are killing smaller rivals, and that small-business owners share interests with other victims of corporate power.”\n\nReplying to Mitt Romney’s statement in 2008 that “corporations are people,” Warren said:\n\nNo, Governor Romney, corporations are not people. People have hearts, they have kids, they get jobs, they get sick, they love, and they die. And that matters. That matter because we don’t run this country for corporations, we run it for people. People feel the system is rigged against them. And here’s the painful part. They’re right. The system is rigged. Look around. Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies. Wall Street CEOs — the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs — still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them.\n\nThere is infinitely more of Warren assailing corporate power, but let’s move to Bernie Sanders. Here is Sanders saying this on page 273 of his book Our Revolution:\n\nCorporate tax reform must start by preventing profitable companies from sheltering profits in tax haven countries like the Cayman Islands. In 2015, I introduced legislation with Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois to do just that. The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would end the loophole that allows corporations to defer paying taxes on overseas profits. Instead, it would require corporations to pay U.S. taxes on offshore profits as they are earned. This bill would take away the tax incentives for corporations to shift profits and move jobs and factories offshore, by taxing their profits no matter where they are generated. American corporations would continue to get a credit against their U.S. tax liability for foreign taxes they pay, but they would have to pay the federal government the difference between the foreign rate and the U.S. rate.\n\nAlso in the Sanders book was this attack on corporations and their control of the media:\n\nIn 1983 the largest fifty corporations controlled 90 percent of the media. That’s a high level of concentration. Today, as a result of massive mergers and takeovers, six corporations control 90 percent of what we see, hear, and read. This is outrageous, and a real threat to our democracy.\n\nOn and on and on I could go with attacks on corporations and corporate power by the New York Times and Senators Warren and Sanders — not to mention other Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nThere is no question that in both exact language and certainly in sentiment the views repeatedly expressed by the Times, Warren, and Sanders matches exactly the language and sentiment of the El Paso killer on corporations and corporate power.\n\nSurprise? In this not so-cleverly disguised attack on Tucker, Sean, Laura, Rush, and the rest, the Times mentions nary a peep of the similarity in language between the shooter’s “manifesto” and the Times itself, as well as Warren and Sanders. Say again: not … a … single … word.\n\nThe obvious conclusion? The left-wing paper wanted to shift responsibility for the shooting from the shooter and blame the stars of conservative media.\n\nBut in playing this game the New York Times managed to hit a decidedly unintended target: the New York Times itself.\n\nOops!",

         "WASHINGTON – For the first time in his presidency , Donald Trump gave his State of the Union address to a divided Congress . The president did n't flinch as he faced a House of Representatives led by Democrats who have recently pushed for late-term abortions .\nTrump boldly pushed back on that agenda , saying America 's leaders need to `` work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life . '' The president then called on Congress to pass legislation to prohibit late-term abortions .\n`` Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother 's womb moments before birth , '' Trump said . `` These are living , feeling , beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world . ''\n`` And then , we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth , '' the president continued . `` All children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of God .

         "2015-05-06",
         "Erica Werner",
         "A high-ranking State Department official said Wednesday it 's `` not acceptable '' for any agency employee to conduct government business on a private email server as former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton did .\nJoyce Barr , the agency 's chief freedom of information officer , made the comment under questioning from Republican senators who used a Senate Judiciary hearing on open records laws to attack Clinton over her email practices .\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas said that Clinton 's approach amounted to a `` premeditated and deliberate '' attempt to avoid open records requirements .\nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said that anyone who took such an approach should be fired , and asked Barr whether it would be considered acceptable .\nBarr said that she had not been aware of Clinton 's decision to conduct all her State Department email on a private server but that the agency has now made it clear to employees that such an approach would not be acceptable .\n`` I think that the actions that we 've taken in the course of recovering these emails have made it very clear what people 's responsibilities are with regard to record-keeping , '' she said . `` We continue to do training , we 've sent department notices , telegrams , we 've talked to directors and I think the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable . ''\nClinton , who is running for president , has defended using a personal email account while serving as secretary of state as a matter of personal convenience . She says she has turned over to the State Department all work-related emails — more than 30,000 of them — though House Republicans investigating the 2012 attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi , Libya , are demanding more . They insist the server itself should be examined by a third party .\nA spokesman for Clinton 's campaign declined comment . Clinton has agreed to testify on Capitol Hill later this month at the request of the special committee investigating the Benghazi attacks .\nBarr acknowledged problems with the State Department 's overall performance responding to open records requests , calling an existing backlog of 18,000 requests `` unacceptable .

         "A high-ranking State Department official said Wednesday it's \"not acceptable\" for any agency employee to conduct government business on a private email server as former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton did.\n\nJoyce Barr, the agency's chief freedom of information officer, made the comment under questioning from Republican senators who used a Senate Judiciary hearing on open records laws to attack Clinton over her email practices.\n\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas said that Clinton's approach amounted to a \"premeditated and deliberate\" attempt to avoid open records requirements.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said that anyone who took such an approach should be fired, and asked Barr whether it would be considered acceptable.\n\nBarr said that she had not been aware of Clinton's decision to conduct all her State Department email on a private server but that the agency has now made it clear to employees that such an approach would not be acceptable.\n\n\"I think that the actions that we've taken in the course of recovering these emails have made it very clear what people's responsibilities are with regard to record-keeping,\" she said. \"We continue to do training, we've sent department notices, telegrams, we've talked to directors and I think the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable.\"\n\nClinton, who is running for president, has defended using a personal email account while serving as secretary of state as a matter of personal convenience. She says she has turned over to the State Department all work-related emails — more than 30,000 of them — though House Republicans investigating the 2012 attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, are demanding more. They insist the server itself should be examined by a third party.\n\nA spokesman for Clinton's campaign declined comment. Clinton has agreed to testify on Capitol Hill later this month at the request of the special committee investigating the Benghazi attacks.\n\nBarr acknowledged problems with the State Department's overall performance responding to open records requests, calling an existing backlog of 18,000 requests \"unacceptable.\" But she insisted improvements were being made even as the number of requests keeps growing and the agency is understaffed. Like other government agencies, the State Department is bound by laws including the Freedom of Information Act that generally require them to maintain records and make them available to the public when asked, with some exceptions.\n\nKaren Kaiser, general counsel at The Associated Press, testified that despite promises of greater transparency by the Obama administration, most agencies are not abiding by their legal obligations under open records laws. \"Non-responsiveness is the norm, and the reflex at most agencies is to withhold information, not to release it,\" she told senators.\n\nLawmakers are weighing legislation to improve the Freedom of Information Act, but Kaiser said agencies should also be made to comply with the laws already enacted.\n\n\"We can have all the wonderful laws on the books and the presumptions of disclosure written in, but if the agencies don't abide by the requirements we're in a bad position,\" she said.",

         "Robert Reich Blog",
         "As a first step , I believe it necessary for the members and leadership of the Democratic National Committee to step down and be replaced by people who are determined to create a party that represents America – including all those who feel powerless and disenfranchised , and who have been left out of our politics and left behind in our economy .\nThe Democratic Party as it is now constituted has become a giant fundraising machine , too often reflecting the goals and values of the moneyed interests . This must change . The election of 2016 has repudiated it . We need a people ’ s party – a party capable of organizing and mobilizing Americans in opposition to Donald Trump ’ s Republican party , which is about to take over all three branches of the U.S. government . We need a New Democratic Party that will fight against intolerance and widening inequality .\nWhat happened in America Tuesday should not be seen as a victory for hatefulness over decency . It is more accurately understood as a repudiation of the American power structure .\nAt the core of that structure are the political leaders of both parties , their political operatives , and fundraisers ; the major media , centered in New York and Washington DC ; the country ’ s biggest corporations , their top executives , and Washington lobbyists and trade associations ; the biggest Wall Street banks , their top officers , traders , hedge-fund and private-equity managers , and their lackeys in Washington ; and the wealthy individuals who invest directly in politics .\nAt the start of the 2016 election cycle , this power structure proclaimed Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush shoo-ins for the nominations of the Democratic and Republican parties . After all , both of these individuals had deep bases of funders , well-established networks of political insiders , experienced political advisers and all the political name recognition any candidate could possibly want .\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the White House . The presidency was won by Donald Trump , who made his fortune marketing office towers and casinos , and , more recently , starring in a popular reality-television program , and who has never held elective office or had anything to do with the Republican party . Hillary Clinton narrowly won the popular vote , but not enough of the states and their electors secure a victory .\nHillary Clinton ’ s defeat is all the more remarkable in that her campaign vastly outspent the Trump campaign on television and radio advertisements , and get-out-the-vote efforts . Moreover , her campaign had the support in the general election not of only the kingpins of the Democratic party but also many leading Republicans , including most of the politically active denizens of Wall Street and the top executives of America ’ s largest corporations , and even former Republican president George HW Bush . Her campaign team was run by seasoned professionals who knew the ropes . She had the visible and forceful backing of Barack Obama , whose popularity has soared in recent months , and his popular wife . And , of course , she had her husband .\nTrump , by contrast , was shunned by the power structure . Mitt Romney , the Republican presidential candidate in 2012 , actively worked against Trump ’ s nomination . Many senior Republicans refused to endorse him , or even give him their support . The Republican National Committee did not raise money for Trump to the extent it had for other Republican candidates for president .\nThere had been hints of the political earthquake to come . Trump had won the Republican primaries , after all . More tellingly , Clinton had been challenged in the Democratic primaries by the unlikeliest of candidates – a 74-year-old Jewish senator from Vermont who described himself as a democratic socialist and who was not even a Democrat . Bernie Sanders went on to win 22 states and 47 percent of the vote in those primaries . Sanders ’ major theme was that the country ’ s political and economic system was rigged in favor of big corporations , Wall Street and the very wealthy .\nThe power structure of America wrote off Sanders as an aberration , and , until recently , didn ’ t take Trump seriously . A respected political insider recently told me most Americans were largely content with the status quo . “ The economy is in good shape , ” he said . “ Most Americans are better off than they ’ ve been in years . ”\nRecent economic indicators may be up , but those indicators don ’ t reflect the insecurity most Americans continue to feel , nor the seeming arbitrariness and unfairness they experience . Nor do the major indicators show the linkages many Americans see between wealth and power , stagnant or declining real wages , soaring CEO pay , and the undermining of democracy by big money .\nMedian family income is lower now than it was 16 years ago , adjusted for inflation . Workers without college degrees – the old working class – have fallen furthest . Most economic gains , meanwhile , have gone to top . These gains have translated into political power to elicit bank bailouts , corporate subsidies , special tax loopholes , favorable trade deals and increasing market power without interference by anti-monopoly enforcement – all of which have further reduced wages and pulled up profits .\nWealth , power and crony capitalism fit together . Americans know a takeover has occurred , and they blame the establishment for it .\nThe Democratic party once represented the working class . But over the last three decades the party has been taken over by Washington-based fundraisers , bundlers , analysts , and pollsters who have focused instead on raising campaign money from corporate and Wall Street executives and getting votes from upper middle-class households in “ swing ” suburbs .\nDemocrats have occupied the White House for 16 of the last 24 years , and for four of those years had control of both houses of Congress . But in that time they failed to reverse the decline in working-class wages and economic security . Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ardently pushed for free trade agreements without providing millions of blue-collar workers who thereby lost their jobs means of getting new ones that paid at least as well .\nThey stood by as corporations hammered trade unions , the backbone of the white working class – failing to reform labor laws to impose meaningful penalties on companies that violate them , or help workers form unions with simple up-or-down votes . Partly as a result , union membership sank from 22 percent of all workers when Bill Clinton was elected president to less than 12 percenttoday , and the working class lost bargaining leverage to get a share of the economy ’ s gains .\nBill Clinton and Obama also allowed antitrust enforcement to ossify – with the result that large corporations have grown far larger , and major industries more concentrated . The unsurprising result of this combination – more trade , declining unionization and more industry concentration – has been to shift political and economic power to big corporations and the wealthy , and to shaft the working class . This created an opening for Donald Trump ’ s authoritarian demagoguery , and his presidency .\nNow Americans have rebelled by supporting someone who wants to fortify America against foreigners as well as foreign-made goods . The power structure understandably fears that Trump ’ s isolationism will stymie economic growth . But most Americans couldn ’ t care less about growth because for years they have received few of its benefits , while suffering most of its burdens in the forms of lost jobs and lower wages .\nThe power structure is shocked by the outcome of the 2016 election because it has cut itself off from the lives of most Americans . Perhaps it also doesn ’ t wish to understand , because that would mean acknowledging its role in enabling the presidency of Donald Trump .\nRobert Reich , one of the nation ’ s leading experts on work and the economy , is Chancellor ’ s Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley . He has served in three national administrations , most recently as secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton . Time Magazine has named him one of the ten most effective cabinet secretaries of the last century . He has written 13 books , including his latest best-seller , “ Aftershock : The Next Economy and America ’ s Future ; ” “ The Work of Nations , ” which has been translated into 22 languages ; and his newest , an e-book , “ Beyond Outrage. ” His syndicated columns , television appearances , and public radio commentaries reach millions of people each week . He is also a founding editor of the American Prospect magazine , and Chairman of the citizen ’ s group Common Cause . His new movie `` Inequality for All '' is in Theaters . His widely-read blog can be found at www.robertreich.org .",

It is more accurately understood as a repudiation of the American power structure.\n\nAt the core of that structure are the political leaders of both parties, their political operatives, and fundraisers; the major media, centered in New York and Washington DC; the country’s biggest corporations, their top executives, and Washington lobbyists and trade associations; the biggest Wall Street banks, their top officers, traders, hedge-fund and private-equity managers, and their lackeys in Washington; and the wealthy individuals who invest directly in politics.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAt the start of the 2016 election cycle, this power structure proclaimed Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush shoo-ins for the nominations of the Democratic and Republican parties. After all, both of these individuals had deep bases of funders, well-established networks of political insiders, experienced political advisers and all the political name recognition any candidate could possibly want.\n\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the White House. The presidency was won by Donald Trump, who made his fortune marketing office towers and casinos, and, more recently, starring in a popular reality-television program, and who has never held elective office or had anything to do with the Republican party. Hillary Clinton narrowly won the popular vote, but not enough of the states and their electors secure a victory.\n\nHillary Clinton’s defeat is all the more remarkable in that her campaign vastly outspent the Trump campaign on television and radio advertisements, and get-out-the-vote efforts. Moreover, her campaign had the support in the general election not of only the kingpins of the Democratic party but also many leading Republicans, including most of the politically active denizens of Wall Street and the top executives of America’s largest corporations, and even former Republican president George HW Bush. Her campaign team was run by seasoned professionals who knew the ropes. She had the visible and forceful backing of Barack Obama, whose popularity has soared in recent months, and his popular wife. And, of course, she had her husband.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTrump, by contrast, was shunned by the power structure. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate in 2012, actively worked against Trump’s nomination. Many senior Republicans refused to endorse him, or even give him their support. The Republican National Committee did not raise money for Trump to the extent it had for other Republican candidates for president.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThere had been hints of the political earthquake to come. Trump had won the Republican primaries, after all. More tellingly, Clinton had been challenged in the Democratic primaries by the unlikeliest of candidates – a 74-year-old Jewish senator from Vermont who described himself as a democratic socialist and who was not even a Democrat. Bernie Sanders went on to win 22 states and 47 percent of the vote in those primaries. Sanders’ major theme was that the country’s political and economic system was rigged in favor of big corporations, Wall Street and the very wealthy.\n\nThe power structure of America wrote off Sanders as an aberration, and, until recently, didn’t take Trump seriously. A respected political insider recently told me most Americans were largely content with the status quo. “The economy is in good shape,” he said. “Most Americans are better off than they’ve been in years.”\n\nRecent economic indicators may be up, but those indicators don’t reflect the insecurity most Americans continue to feel, nor the seeming arbitrariness and unfairness they experience. Nor do the major indicators show the linkages many Americans see between wealth and power, stagnant or declining real wages, soaring CEO pay, and the undermining of democracy by big money.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMedian family income is lower now than it was 16 years ago, adjusted for inflation. Workers without college degrees – the old working class – have fallen furthest. Most economic gains, meanwhile, have gone to top. These gains have translated into political power to elicit bank bailouts, corporate subsidies, special tax loopholes, favorable trade deals and increasing market power without interference by anti-monopoly enforcement – all of which have further reduced wages and pulled up profits.\n\nWealth, power and crony capitalism fit together. Americans know a takeover has occurred, and they blame the establishment for it.\n\nThe Democratic party once represented the working class. But over the last three decades the party has been taken over by Washington-based fundraisers, bundlers, analysts, and pollsters who have focused instead on raising campaign money from corporate and Wall Street executives and getting votes from upper middle-class households in “swing” suburbs.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nDemocrats have occupied the White House for 16 of the last 24 years, and for four of those years had control of both houses of Congress. But in that time they failed to reverse the decline in working-class wages and economic security. Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ardently pushed for free trade agreements without providing millions of blue-collar workers who thereby lost their jobs means of getting new ones that paid at least as well.\n\nThey stood by as corporations hammered trade unions, the backbone of the white working class – failing to reform labor laws to impose meaningful penalties on companies that violate them, or help workers form unions with simple up-or-down votes. Partly as a result, union membership sank from 22 percent of all workers when Bill Clinton was elected president to less than 12 percenttoday, and the working class lost bargaining leverage to get a share of the economy’s gains.\n\nBill Clinton and Obama also allowed antitrust enforcement to ossify – with the result that large corporations have grown far larger, and major industries more concentrated. The unsurprising result of this combination – more trade, declining unionization and more industry concentration – has been to shift political and economic power to big corporations and the wealthy, and to shaft the working class. This created an opening for Donald Trump’s authoritarian demagoguery, and his presidency.\n\nNow Americans have rebelled by supporting someone who wants to fortify America against foreigners as well as foreign-made goods. The power structure understandably fears that Trump’s isolationism will stymie economic growth. But most Americans couldn’t care less about growth because for years they have received few of its benefits, while suffering most of its burdens in the forms of lost jobs and lower wages.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe power structure is shocked by the outcome of the 2016 election because it has cut itself off from the lives of most Americans. Perhaps it also doesn’t wish to understand, because that would mean acknowledging its role in enabling the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nRobert Reich, one of the nation’s leading experts on work and the economy, is Chancellor’s Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley.

         "After 10 years of silence - a decade of dodging questions about the infamous stain on her blue dress and the jokes about the president's cigar - Bill Clinton's mistress, Monica Lewinsky, spoke out in Vanity Fair.\n\nRemembering the Monica Lewinsky Scandal\n\nHere's what she had to say:\n\n1. She May Not Stay Quiet if Hillary Runs\n\nLewinsky says she \"remained virtually reclusive\" during Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign despite repeated interview requests. Now that Hillary is reportedly mulling a 2016 bid, Lewinsky finds herself \"gun-shy yet again, fearful of 'becoming an issue' should she decide to ramp up her campaign.\" But she's not sure she'll stay quiet this time.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who says she's still recognized everywhere she goes, has had enough of \"tiptoeing around my past - and other people's futures.\"\n\nSo though she acknowledges speaking out may have severe ramifications, \"I've decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past … It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress.\"\n\n2.

The Relationship Was Consensual\n\nLewinsky maintains that her relationship with Clinton was voluntary.\n\n\"Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship,\" Lewinsky writes. \"Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position.\"\n\nNevertheless, she says, she \"regrets\" the relationship. \"Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened.,\" she writes.\n\n4. The Clintons Didn't Pay Her Off\n\nThe Clintons didn't bribe her to stay quiet, Lewinsky insists.\n\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" she writes.

She Contemplated Suicide\n\nThough she never actually attempted suicide, Lewinsky says she was tempted end her own life as \"the shame, the scorn, and the fear\" washed over her.\n\nShe says the tragic suicide of 18-year-old Tyler Clementi, the gay Rutgers student who was filmed kissing another man, brought back those terrible memories and inspired her to come forward.\n\n\"Perhaps by sharing my story … I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation,\" Lewinksi says.",

         "2019-09-24",
         "Oliver Jj Lane",
         "The United Kingdom Supreme Court has ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was acting unlawfully when he suspended Parliament in August for five weeks , a move which anti-Brexit campaigners claimed was intended to thwart their attempts to prevent Britain leaving the European Union .\nIn a shock ruling which strongly went against the government on every count , the Supreme Court in London unanimously found Tuesday morning that Boris Johnson ’ s decision to suspend Parliament was not only unlawful but was null and void , meaning it legally did not take place . Parliament is now free to sit again as soon as desired by the speakers of both houses , the court explained .\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now reacted , speaking to the BBC on a balcony of the United Nations building in New York , insisting that despite the court ruling against him this morning Brexit would still be going ahead at the end of October as planned .\nIn remarks that have already angered remainers , the Prime Minister said he regretted the decision of the court but pointed out the coalition of anti-Brexit campaigners who have worked tirelessly to prevent Britain ’ s withdrawal from going ahead .\nAs I say , I strongly disagree with this decision of the supreme court , I have the utmost respect for our judiciary , I don ’ think this was the right decision I think that the prerogative of prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge . It is perfectly usual to have Queen ’ s speech , that ’ s what we want to do . More importantly , let ’ s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit . There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU . We have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued , doesn ’ t want to have an election , and I think it is time we took things forward . …as the law currently stands , the UK leaves the EU on October the 31st come what may , but the interesting , exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal and that ’ s what we are working on . And I ’ ll be honest with you… it is not made much easier by this kind of stuff in Parliament and the courts . Obviously getting a deal is not made much easier against this background but we ’ ve got to get on and do it . …As the law stands we leave on October the 31st and I am very hopeful that we will get a deal , and I think what the people of the country want is to see Parliamentarians coming together , working in the national interest to get this thing done , and that is what we are going to do .\nA government spokesman has said the Prime Minister will not resign , and he will return to the United Kingdom tonight after his speech to the United Nations .\nUpdate 1305 : Farage calls Boris proroguing parliament “ worst political decision ever ”\nBrexit leader Nigel Farage has no sympathy for Boris Johnson ’ s unforced error and has said his chief advisor Dominic Cummings — who has frequently crossed swords with Farage & co in the past — should step down over the affair which he is widely thought to have engineered .\nSpeaking to Breitbart London before the ruling was made , Mr Farage said : “ We have a Parliament that twice has stopped us from having a General Election and instead we have a Supreme Court making a decision as to whether Boris Johnson remains prime minister ; virtually , that ’ s how important the ruling is .\n“ I don ’ t like it one little bit and I think our whole constitution has been thrown completely up into the air by Speaker Bercow and others . ”\nRead that and the responses of other political figures at Breitbart London\nThe Supreme Court was the creation of the Blair years of government , a time of enormous constitutional and political change in the United Kingdom . As Breitbart London ’ s James Delingpole has it , the court Blair created is now doing his bidding . Read more here\nDelingpole : Judicial Enemies of the People Sabotage Brexit Again https : //t.co/GwteWW9Wyz — Breitbart London ( @ BreitbartLondon ) September 24 , 2019\nCommons speaker John Bercow has spoken to reporters outside Parliament , answering the questions over when Parliament would resume , given the Supreme Court has given it leave to do so whenever it wishes . The answer is Wednesday morning , with opportunities for members to make urgent questions , request emergency debates , and to hold ministers to account . Expect fireworks .\nBREAKING : Speaker Bercow : Parliament Will ‘ Resume ’ Wednesday After Supreme Court Nullification of Suspension https : //t.co/2kWH5SaOKa — Breitbart London ( @ BreitbartLondon ) September 24 , 2019\nAnti-Brexit politicians have leapt upon the ruling as resembling a fatal blow against Boris Johnson , who it is claimed could be the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history if he were ousted now . But what or who could replace Mr Johnson is not clear as no single party can command a majority in Parliament .\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed his party ’ s annual conference in Brighton as the ruling was made , and told the delegates there that the Prime Minister should “ consider his position ” . Speaking outside the Supreme Court former Tory MP turned independent Anna Soubry also called on the Prime Minister to resign , saying it was time for what she unironically calls a government of national unity to take power . Presumably formed of a coalition of opposition parties , the purpose of the much-discussed “ unity ” government would be to overturn Brexit , it has been claimed — despite delivering Brexit being the majority position in the United Kingdom .\nThe first question was whether the court even had the right to consider the question — a matter of jurisdiction . Some had argued the division of powers under the UK constitution meant it would not be proper for the unelected judiciary to make decisions on the acts of the executive — the government — but the court disagreed , stating they believed they had the right . In the words of Lady Brenda Hale who read out the unanimous decision of the 11 justices , the matter was “ judicable ” , and for for them to decide on .\nLady Hale explained : “ …this was not an ordinary prorogation in the run-up to a Queen ’ s speech . It prevented Parliament from carrying out its constitutional role in five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and the exit day on the 31st of October . Proroguing Parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess .\n“ While Parliament is Prorogued , neither house can meet , debate , or pass legislation . Neither house can debate government policy . Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers , or meet and take evidence in committees . ”\nOf the decision to Prorogue itself , Lady Hale said : “ The decision to ask her majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing Parliament from carrying out its constitutional functions without justification . ”\nMr Johnson had used a mechanism known in Westminster parlance as Prorogation to suspend Parliament , usually a normal and regular event in Parliamentary life , but one met this time with outrage by anti-Brexiteers . Normal Parliamentary sessions have lasted between one and two years , being regularly suspended to clear out old unfinished legislation and to allow new government programmes to be launched .\nBut amid the endless Parliamentary discussion over whether to honour the result of the 2016 referendum which saw the British people vote by a margin of over one million votes — the largest democratic mandate given in British history — this Parliamentary session has rumbled on , becoming the longest since the infamous ‘ long Parliament ’ of the English Civil War .\nThe government under Mr Johnson insisted given those circumstances , and the fact the UK government has not yet been able to introduce new domestic legislation , it was reasonable to suspend Parliament .\nAnti-Brexit activists claim the Prime Minister not only lied to the country , but lied to the Queen , as under the British constitutional system she has to be asked as a formality to suspend Parliament .\nThe Associated Press has created this handy timeline of the most recent events leading up to today , to give some context for today ’ s ruling :\nJuly 24 , 2019 : Boris Johnson becomes prime minister after winning a party leadership contest to succeed Theresa May .

         "The United Kingdom Supreme Court has ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was acting unlawfully when he suspended Parliament in August for five weeks, a move which anti-Brexit campaigners claimed was intended to thwart their attempts to prevent Britain leaving the European Union.\n\nIn a shock ruling which strongly went against the government on every count, the Supreme Court in London unanimously found Tuesday morning that Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament was not only unlawful but was null and void, meaning it legally did not take place. Parliament is now free to sit again as soon as desired by the speakers of both houses, the court explained.\n\nUpdate 1330: Boris Johnson speaks\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now reacted, speaking to the BBC on a balcony of the United Nations building in New York, insisting that despite the court ruling against him this morning Brexit would still be going ahead at the end of October as planned.\n\nIn remarks that have already angered remainers, the Prime Minister said he regretted the decision of the court but pointed out the coalition of anti-Brexit campaigners who have worked tirelessly to prevent Britain’s withdrawal from going ahead.\n\nThe Prime Minister told the BBC:\n\nAs I say, I strongly disagree with this decision of the supreme court, I have the utmost respect for our judiciary, I don’ think this was the right decision I think that the prerogative of prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge. It is perfectly usual to have Queen’s speech, that’s what we want to do. More importantly, let’s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit. There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU. We have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued, doesn’t want to have an election, and I think it is time we took things forward. …as the law currently stands, the UK leaves the EU on October the 31st come what may, but the interesting, exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal and that’s what we are working on. And I’ll be honest with you… it is not made much easier by this kind of stuff in Parliament and the courts. Obviously getting a deal is not made much easier against this background but we’ve got to get on and do it. …As the law stands we leave on October the 31st and I am very hopeful that we will get a deal, and I think what the people of the country want is to see Parliamentarians coming together, working in the national interest to get this thing done, and that is what we are going to do.\n\nA government spokesman has said the Prime Minister will not resign, and he will return to the United Kingdom tonight after his speech to the United Nations.\n\nUpdate 1305: Farage calls Boris proroguing parliament “worst political decision ever”\n\nBrexit leader Nigel Farage has no sympathy for Boris Johnson’s unforced error and has said his chief advisor Dominic Cummings — who has frequently crossed swords with Farage & co in the past — should step down over the affair which he is widely thought to have engineered.\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart London before the ruling was made, Mr Farage said: “We have a Parliament that twice has stopped us from having a General Election and instead we have a Supreme Court making a decision as to whether Boris Johnson remains prime minister; virtually, that’s how important the ruling is.\n\n“I don’t like it one little bit and I think our whole constitution has been thrown completely up into the air by Speaker Bercow and others.”\n\nRead that and the responses of other political figures at Breitbart London\n\nUpdate 1255: Tony Blair’s lingering influence on British politics\n\nThe Supreme Court was the creation of the Blair years of government, a time of enormous constitutional and political change in the United Kingdom. As Breitbart London’s James Delingpole has it, the court Blair created is now doing his bidding.

The answer is Wednesday morning, with opportunities for members to make urgent questions, request emergency debates, and to hold ministers to account. Expect fireworks.\n\nBREAKING: Speaker Bercow: Parliament Will ‘Resume’ Wednesday After Supreme Court Nullification of Suspension https://t.co/2kWH5SaOKa — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 24, 2019\n\nUpdate 1115: Calls for the Prime Minister to resign\n\nAnti-Brexit politicians have leapt upon the ruling as resembling a fatal blow against Boris Johnson, who it is claimed could be the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history if he were ousted now.

         "Today is newly seated Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch 's first day at the office hearing cases . He is apparently not going to be a quiet , Clarence Thomas-style justice and asked several questions during the first case before the court .\nBefore this morning 's case—which is a procedurally-oriented matter about the processes required appeal federal work discrimination complaints—the Supreme Court released its list of orders from last week 's conference and decided not to take any new cases as yet . Gorsuch did not participate in this last conference but will for the next one .\nThis matters because the Supreme Court has repeatedly declined to make a decision whether to take a high-profile case about businesses declining to serve gay weddings and has been bumping it to future conferences since last December . It rescheduled the case yet again this morning .\nThat case is Masterpiece Cakeshop Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission . This is a case about wedding cakes , gay marriage , and whether businesses can decline to provide their goods and services on the basis of religious beliefs . Jack Phillips , owners of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood , Colorado , declined ( all the way back in 2013 ) to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple 's wedding . This decision ran him afoul of Colorado 's public accommodation laws , which forbid discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation .\nPhillips ' response , as we have seen in many of these cases , is that he 's not refusing to serve gay people , but he has religious objections to gay marriage and sees being obligated to make a wedding cake as being compelled to put his stamp of approval on it . Courts across the country have disagreed with Phillips and other businesses that serve weddings , like florists and photographers . Courts have thus far declined to accept the argument that refusing to serve gay weddings is somehow different from refusing to serve gay people . Furthermore courts have declined to accept the claim that floral arrangements or wedding cakes are a form of protected expression and that compliance with law compels speech or forces people to compromise their religious beliefs .\nThat the Supreme Court kept pushing back a decision on whether to take this case until now is significant because they 've already previously rejected to hear a similar fight . A photographer in New Mexico tried to get the court in 2014 to hear their case where the state told them they could n't refuse to provide their services for a gay couple 's wedding . The photography company , like Masterpiece Cakeshop , lost their challenge to the law , and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case .\nNow , three years later , the court appears to be delaying a decision at least until Gorsuch has been seated . There have n't been any cases where higher courts have accepted the arguments of the religious shop owners , so there 's no `` split '' that requires the Supreme Court to resolve .

         "More Democrats call for impeachment after Mueller makes statement",
         null,
         null,
         "Three more prominent US Democrats have called for the impeachment of President Trump , after Special Counsel Robert Mueller made his first public remarks .\nSpeaking on Wednesday , Mr Mueller said his investigation had not exonerated Mr Trump of obstruction of justice , contradicting the president 's claims .\nMr Mueller was tasked with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election .\nHe said charging a sitting president with a crime was not an option .\nThe issue of impeachment has divided the Democratic Party , pitting a growing number of lawmakers against Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the house and the most senior Democrat . Ms Pelosi has so far resisted the idea , arguing that it would be counter-productive .\nBut Mr Mueller 's remarks prompted three leading Democratic presidential hopefuls to join the chorus calling for impeachment , bringing the total to 10 of 23 declared candidates .\nAt the White House on Thursday morning , Mr Trump said Mr Mueller was `` a totally conflicted person '' and a `` true Never Trumper '' , referring to his Republican critics in the 2016 White House race .\nHe also said impeachment was a `` dirty , filthy disgusting word '' and the inquiry was `` a giant presidential harassment '' .\nIn response to Mr Mueller 's remarks , Democratic candidates Cory Booker , Kirsten Gillibrand and Pete Buttigieg publicly advocated for the first time for impeachment .\n`` Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately , '' said Mr Booker , a senator from New Jersey .\nNew York Senator Ms Gillibrand said it was `` time for Republicans and Democrats to begin impeachment hearings and follow the facts wherever they may lead '' .\nIndiana mayor Pete Buttigieg tweeted : `` This is as close to an impeachment referral as it gets . ''\nOther senators reiterated earlier calls for impeachment . `` It is up to Congress to hold this president accountable . We need to start impeachment proceedings , '' said California senator Kamala Harris .\nVermont senator Bernie Sanders stopped short of endorsing proceedings , but said in an Instagram post : `` If the House Judiciary Committee deems it necessary , I will support their decision to open an impeachment inquiry . ''\nResponding to Mr Mueller 's statement , House Speaker Ms Pelosi said : `` The Congress holds sacred its constitutional responsibility to investigate and hold the President accountable for his abuse of power . ''\nMr Trump said on Twitter there was `` insufficient evidence '' against him , `` and therefore , in our Country , a person is innocent '' .\nRepresentative Doug Collins , the most senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , said that `` reinvestigating the special counsel 's findings '' would `` only further divide our country '' .\nThe first Republican congressman to call for Mr Trump 's impeachment , Representative Justin Amash , said : `` The ball is in our court , Congress . ''\nMeanwhile , White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said : `` After two years , the Special Counsel is moving on with his life , and everyone else should do the same . ''\nMr Mueller largely reaffirmed what was in his report , which was released last month to the public , with substantial redactions .\nHe detailed 10 instances where Mr Trump had possibly attempted to impede the investigation , but said that charging the president with a crime was not an option for the special counsel .\n`` The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing , '' he said , in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process .\nHe said that if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump `` clearly did not commit a crime , we would have said so '' .\nMr Mueller said he did not believe it was `` appropriate to speak further '' about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team 's report .\nWith Democratic lawmakers seeking to have him testify in Congress , Mr Mueller said : `` The report is my testimony . ''\nHe also announced the formal closure of the special counsel office and his resignation from the justice department to return to private life .\nRobert Mueller did n't break much new ground in his eight-minute statement announcing the official end of the special counsel investigation . Instead , he highlighted in bold what he views as the key points of nearly two years of work .\nMr Mueller started and ended by emphasising that America during the 2016 election was under attack by malign foreign actors . He said those allegations deserve the attention of every American .\nIn the portion of his investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign , Mr Mueller said there was `` insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy '' - hardly the complete vindication the president asserts .\nWhen it comes to obstruction of justice , he chipped away further at the president 's defences .

         "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Robert Mueller: No confidence that there was no crime\n\nThree more prominent US Democrats have called for the impeachment of President Trump, after Special Counsel Robert Mueller made his first public remarks.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Mr Mueller said his investigation had not exonerated Mr Trump of obstruction of justice, contradicting the president's claims.\n\nMr Mueller was tasked with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHe said charging a sitting president with a crime was not an option.\n\nThe issue of impeachment has divided the Democratic Party, pitting a growing number of lawmakers against Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the house and the most senior Democrat. Ms Pelosi has so far resisted the idea, arguing that it would be counter-productive.\n\nBut Mr Mueller's remarks prompted three leading Democratic presidential hopefuls to join the chorus calling for impeachment, bringing the total to 10 of 23 declared candidates.\n\nAt the White House on Thursday morning, Mr Trump said Mr Mueller was \"a totally conflicted person\" and a \"true Never Trumper\", referring to his Republican critics in the 2016 White House race.\n\nHe also said impeachment was a \"dirty, filthy disgusting word\" and the inquiry was \"a giant presidential harassment\".\n\nWho is calling for impeachment?\n\nIn response to Mr Mueller's remarks, Democratic candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Pete Buttigieg publicly advocated for the first time for impeachment.\n\n\"Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately,\" said Mr Booker, a senator from New Jersey.\n\nNew York Senator Ms Gillibrand said it was \"time for Republicans and Democrats to begin impeachment hearings and follow the facts wherever they may lead\".\n\nIndiana mayor Pete Buttigieg tweeted: \"This is as close to an impeachment referral as it gets.\"\n\nOther senators reiterated earlier calls for impeachment. \"It is up to Congress to hold this president accountable. We need to start impeachment proceedings,\" said California senator Kamala Harris.\n\nVermont senator Bernie Sanders stopped short of endorsing proceedings, but said in an Instagram post: \"If the House Judiciary Committee deems it necessary, I will support their decision to open an impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nResponding to Mr Mueller's statement, House Speaker Ms Pelosi said: \"The Congress holds sacred its constitutional responsibility to investigate and hold the President accountable for his abuse of power.\"\n\nHow did Republicans react?\n\nMr Trump said on Twitter there was \"insufficient evidence\" against him, \"and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent\".\n\nRepresentative Doug Collins, the most senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said that \"reinvestigating the special counsel's findings\" would \"only further divide our country\".\n\nThe first Republican congressman to call for Mr Trump's impeachment, Representative Justin Amash, said: \"The ball is in our court, Congress.\"\n\nMeanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said: \"After two years, the Special Counsel is moving on with his life, and everyone else should do the same.\"\n\nWhat did Mueller say?\n\nMr Mueller largely reaffirmed what was in his report, which was released last month to the public, with substantial redactions.\n\nHe detailed 10 instances where Mr Trump had possibly attempted to impede the investigation, but said that charging the president with a crime was not an option for the special counsel.\n\n\"The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,\" he said, in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions\n\nHe said that if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump \"clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so\".\n\nMr Mueller said he did not believe it was \"appropriate to speak further\" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report.\n\nWith Democratic lawmakers seeking to have him testify in Congress, Mr Mueller said: \"The report is my testimony.\"\n\nHe also announced the formal closure of the special counsel office and his resignation from the justice department to return to private life.\n\nRobert Mueller didn't break much new ground in his eight-minute statement announcing the official end of the special counsel investigation. Instead, he highlighted in bold what he views as the key points of nearly two years of work.\n\nMr Mueller started and ended by emphasising that America during the 2016 election was under attack by malign foreign actors. He said those allegations deserve the attention of every American.\n\nIn the portion of his investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, Mr Mueller said there was \"insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy\" - hardly the complete vindication the president asserts.\n\nWhen it comes to obstruction of justice, he chipped away further at the president's defences. Mr Trump wasn't exonerated, \"charging the president\" wasn't an option. If Mr Mueller has his way, his role in this drama is at an end. His report speaks for itself, he said, and he wouldn't engage in \"conclusions or hypotheticals about the president\".\n\nThat may not be enough for Democrats in Congress, who still want to question Mr Mueller in person. If Mr Mueller is to be believed, however, all they need to know - all he will offer them - is written in the pages of his report.",

In the news pages, Trump’s coverage was so favorable that the New Yorker magazine said the Enquirer embraced him “with sycophantic fervor.”\n\nPositive headlines for Trump, a Republican, were matched by negative stories about his opponents, including Hillary Clinton, a Democrat: An Enquirer front page from 2015 said “Hillary: 6 Months to Live” and accompanied the headline with a picture of an unsmiling Clinton with bags under her eyes.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Chad Day and Jake Pearson contributed to this report.",

         "The Walter Scott outrage nobody is talking about",
         "2015-04-14",
         "Heather Digparton",
         "The horrific story of the unarmed Walter Scott 's death at the hands of Officer Michael Slager continues to reverberate . Aside from the incontrovertible evidence on the tape that the accused officer shot him in the back as if he were doing target practice , there has since emerged more tape of the traffic stop itself and audio of the officer speaking with his superiors on the phone raising even more questions about his state of mind at the time of the shooting . But as journalists have gone back and studied the officer 's record and found that he was previously investigated for taser abuse . And on even further investigation it was found that this jurisdiction is known as `` Taser town '' :\nUntil the eight shots heard ’ round the world , cops in North Charleston , South Carolina , were primarily distinguished by their zesty use of Tasers . As computed by a local newspaper in 2006 , cops there used Tasers 201 times in an 18-month period , averaging once every 40 hours in one six-month stretch and disproportionately upon African Americans . The Charleston Post & Courier did the tally after the death of a mentally ill man named Kip Black , who was tasered six times on one occasion and nine times on another . Black died immediately after the second jolting , though the coroner set the cause of death as cocaine-fueled “ excited delirium syndrome . ”\nIt 's important to note that Taser International has spent large sums convincing local coroners that this syndrome ( which primarily seems to kill people in police custody ) makes it the victim 's responsibility if they have the bad luck to die from being shot full of electricity with a taser . It 's not just illegal drugs in the system which can allegedly cause it . Adrenaline can as well . So if a person fails to remain calm in face of an arrest and finds the feeling of 50,000 volts going through their system to be stressful they have no one to blame but themselves if they die .\nThose who have been following the story of Walter Scott understand the significance of the taser . It 's not just that the officer evidently lied about Scott taking his taser , thus somehow justifying his using lethal force , or the fact that he appears to have tried to plant the taser next to the slain man 's body to cover his tracks . The man who filmed the shooting said this :\n“ I remember the police had control of the situation . He had control of Scott , and Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser . You can hear the sound of the Taser ... before I started recording . I believe he just wanted to get away from the Taser . ”\nIt 's not unusual for people to try to escape from a taser if they can . It is , quite literally , a torture device designed to force compliance with terrible pain . The people of Taser Town , particularly African American men , undoubtedly understand exactly what is going to happen if they find themselves in the custody of a police officer . Here 's one example of how it would likely go down , as reported by The Guardian :\nSlager is among three patrolmen named in a lawsuit filed by Julius Wilson , who said he was arrested after being stopped in his car in August last year . Wilson is also suing the city of North Charleston , the city police department and police chief Eddie Driggers . Speaking at a press conference on Monday , Wilson described Slager and his colleagues as “ bad , corrupt cops ” . He said : “ The use of excessive force or punishment to torture suspects is not something that should be tolerated by the North Charleston police department. ” [ ... ]\nWilson , who has a criminal record , said he was stopped on 25 August because his vehicle had a broken tail light . Scott , 50 , was stopped for the same reason on 5 April before fleeing and being shot dead by Slager . Wilson was stopped by an Officer Edwards , he said , who was joined 10 minutes later by Slager and an officer Clemens despite Wilson calmly “ making small talk and laughing ” . After refusing to step out until he was told why he was being arrested , Wilson claimed , he was forcibly pulled out of his vehicle by Slager and the two other officers . The three then “ forcibly restrained Wilson on his stomach on the pavement face down , ” the lawsuit stated . Despite Wilson “ not moving , nor resisting ” and lying with his hands above his head , the lawsuit claimed , Slager broke a silence among the officers by shouting : “ Watch out ! I ’ m going to tase ! ” He then allegedly “ shot his NCPD-issued taser into Wilson ’ s back ” . The lawsuit alleged Wilson “ writhed in pain from the electric shock ” . It said when Slager warned his colleagues he was about to fire his taser , “ Wilson was cooperating fully ” and allowing the two other officers to place his hands behind his back .\nTasers guidelines vary by department and jurisdiction , but generally their use is only considered reasonable when the subject poses a safety threat . Clearly , shooting an unarmed 50-year-old man when he runs from the taser is not one of those cases . The video of the Scott incident shows that Officer Slager is confused on that issue , to say the least . And it 's just as clear , based on that same standard , that nobody could ever claim such force is justified when presented with an unarmed suspect facing down on the ground , with his hands behind his back .

         "The horrific story of the unarmed Walter Scott's death at the hands of Officer Michael Slager continues to reverberate. Aside from the incontrovertible evidence on the tape that the accused officer shot him in the back as if he were doing target practice, there has since emerged more tape of the traffic stop itself and audio of the officer speaking with his superiors on the phone raising even more questions about his state of mind at the time of the shooting. But as journalists have gone back and studied the officer's record and found that he was previously investigated for taser abuse. And on even further investigation it was found that this jurisdiction is known as \"Taser town\":\n\nUntil the eight shots heard ’round the world, cops in North Charleston, South Carolina, were primarily distinguished by their zesty use of Tasers. As computed by a local newspaper in 2006, cops there used Tasers 201 times in an 18-month period, averaging once every 40 hours in one six-month stretch and disproportionately upon African Americans. The Charleston Post & Courier did the tally after the death of a mentally ill man named Kip Black, who was tasered six times on one occasion and nine times on another. Black died immediately after the second jolting, though the coroner set the cause of death as cocaine-fueled “excited delirium syndrome.”\n\nIt's important to note that Taser International has spent large sums convincing local coroners that this syndrome (which primarily seems to kill people in police custody) makes it the victim's responsibility if they have the bad luck to die from being shot full of electricity with a taser. It's not just illegal drugs in the system which can allegedly cause it. Adrenaline can as well. So if a person fails to remain calm in face of an arrest and finds the feeling of 50,000 volts going through their system to be stressful they have no one to blame but themselves if they die.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThose who have been following the story of Walter Scott understand the significance of the taser. It's not just that the officer evidently lied about Scott taking his taser, thus somehow justifying his using lethal force, or the fact that he appears to have tried to plant the taser next to the slain man's body to cover his tracks. The man who filmed the shooting said this:\n\n“I remember the police had control of the situation. He had control of Scott, and Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser. You can hear the sound of the Taser ... before I started recording. I believe he just wanted to get away from the Taser.”\n\nIt's not unusual for people to try to escape from a taser if they can. It is, quite literally, a torture device designed to force compliance with terrible pain. The people of Taser Town, particularly African American men, undoubtedly understand exactly what is going to happen if they find themselves in the custody of a police officer. Here's one example of how it would likely go down, as reported by The Guardian:\n\nSlager is among three patrolmen named in a lawsuit filed by Julius Wilson, who said he was arrested after being stopped in his car in August last year. Wilson is also suing the city of North Charleston, the city police department and police chief Eddie Driggers. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Wilson described Slager and his colleagues as “bad, corrupt cops”. He said: “The use of excessive force or punishment to torture suspects is not something that should be tolerated by the North Charleston police department.”[...]\n\nWilson, who has a criminal record, said he was stopped on 25 August because his vehicle had a broken tail light. Scott, 50, was stopped for the same reason on 5 April before fleeing and being shot dead by Slager. Wilson was stopped by an Officer Edwards, he said, who was joined 10 minutes later by Slager and an officer Clemens despite Wilson calmly “making small talk and laughing”. After refusing to step out until he was told why he was being arrested, Wilson claimed, he was forcibly pulled out of his vehicle by Slager and the two other officers. The three then “forcibly restrained Wilson on his stomach on the pavement face down,” the lawsuit stated. Despite Wilson “not moving, nor resisting” and lying with his hands above his head, the lawsuit claimed, Slager broke a silence among the officers by shouting: “Watch out! I’m going to tase!” He then allegedly “shot his NCPD-issued taser into Wilson’s back”. The lawsuit alleged Wilson “writhed in pain from the electric shock”. It said when Slager warned his colleagues he was about to fire his taser, “Wilson was cooperating fully” and allowing the two other officers to place his hands behind his back.\n\nTasers guidelines vary by department and jurisdiction, but generally their use is only considered reasonable when the subject poses a safety threat. Clearly, shooting an unarmed 50-year-old man when he runs from the taser is not one of those cases. The video of the Scott incident shows that Officer Slager is confused on that issue, to say the least. And it's just as clear, based on that same standard, that nobody could ever claim such force is justified when presented with an unarmed suspect facing down on the ground, with his hands behind his back. Using a taser in that situation is simply a form of unofficial street justice, a little torture at the hands of the authorities to make a point. Tasers are not simply used in place of lethal force, and they're not always used to force compliance. They are very often used as on-the-spot punishment by police who want to teach citizens a lesson.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTake the now notorious California incident that happened to be filmed by a local news station, in which a man on horseback led police on a chase through the desert.

         "WASHINGTON – ███ News has confirmed that at least a few people walked out of an intense invite-only evangelical meeting this week at Wheaton College after the affair turned into `` crazy Trump bashing . ''\nThe two-day gathering involved a group of faith leaders and was billed as a discussion of the evangelical movement in light of Trump 's presidency . But it became more than that .\nTwo sources with intimate knowledge of the meeting say the first day turned into a lot of `` one-sided venting '' against President Trump and the majority of evangelicals who voted for him .\nBoth sources confirm that the issue of sin came up in discussing how evangelicals could vote for Trump . `` The conversations were difficult , '' according to one source who attended both days of the meeting . `` There was a lament . ''\nAfter that first day , a few people felt so uncomfortable with the rhetoric against Trump they left , forgoing the last day of the conference .\nIt 's important to note that no members of President Trump 's faith advisory group were present or ever officially invited .\nRather , this group of evangelicals consisted of many who hold more moderate or progressive views on certain public policy issues .\nPastor Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Dallas is part of the president 's evangelical advisory group and says this gathering is of no consequence .\n`` It ’ s a meeting that will have very little impact on evangelicalism as a whole , '' Jeffress told ███ News . `` Many of them are sincere but they are having a hard time understanding that they have little impact on evangelicalism . ''\nREAD : Faith Inside the Oval Office : Evangelical Advisor Shares What It 's Like to Counsel Trump\nRichard Land of Southern Evangelical Seminary also questioned the weight of the meeting given the absence of some well-known names .\n`` Any definition of 'thought leaders ' and any definition of evangelicalism that excludes the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Franklin Graham is a pale imitation – anemic and incomplete , '' said Land .\nOther members of Trump ’ s faith advisory council spoke to ███ News off the record , one voicing his concern over what he sees as this group of evangelicals trying to steal the microphone from those who support Trump . He pointed to the fact that many invited to participate are part of the anti-Trump movement and hold more progressive views on public policy than traditional evangelical Christian voters who supported Trump in 2016 .\nJohnnie Moore , an unofficial spokesman for the faith advisory council , was among the many pro-Trump evangelicals not invited .\n`` We don ’ t take it personally ; we just pray for them , '' Moore said in a statement to ███ News . `` I ’ ve said it many , many times , but I ’ ll say it again : we have been honored to fight to protect religious liberty that even extends to protecting the rights of those who disagree with us on religious grounds , even when they are unkind . ''\nIn total , the meeting included about 50 faith leaders and scholars and was spearheaded by Doug Birdsall , Rev . Dr. Gabriel A. Salguero and Jenny Yang .\nMORE : 'Winning Power Was Judas 's Goal ' : These Christian Leaders Pitched Pre-Trump Unity , Now , Not So Much\nSalguero was appointed as a member of President Obama 's Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and has spoken at the Democrat National Committee Convention in the past .\nOther attendees included Timothy Keller , Mark Labberton and A.R .

But it became more than that.\n\nTwo sources with intimate knowledge of the meeting say the first day turned into a lot of \"one-sided venting\" against President Trump and the majority of evangelicals who voted for him.\n\nBoth sources confirm that the issue of sin came up in discussing how evangelicals could vote for Trump. \"The conversations were difficult,\" according to one source who attended both days of the meeting. \"There was a lament.\"\n\nAfter that first day, a few people felt so uncomfortable with the rhetoric against Trump they left, forgoing the last day of the conference.\n\nIt's important to note that no members of President Trump's faith advisory group were present or ever officially invited.\n\nRather, this group of evangelicals consisted of many who hold more moderate or progressive views on certain public policy issues.\n\nPastor Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Dallas is part of the president's evangelical advisory group and says this gathering is of no consequence.\n\n\"It’s a meeting that will have very little impact on evangelicalism as a whole,\" Jeffress told CBN News. \"Many of them are sincere but they are having a hard time understanding that they have little impact on evangelicalism.\"\n\nREAD: Faith Inside the Oval Office: Evangelical Advisor Shares What It's Like to Counsel Trump\n\nRichard Land of Southern Evangelical Seminary also questioned the weight of the meeting given the absence of some well-known names.\n\n\"Any definition of 'thought leaders' and any definition of evangelicalism that excludes the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Franklin Graham is a pale imitation – anemic and incomplete,\" said Land.\n\nOther members of Trump’s faith advisory council spoke to CBN News off the record, one voicing his concern over what he sees as this group of evangelicals trying to steal the microphone from those who support Trump. He pointed to the fact that many invited to participate are part of the anti-Trump movement and hold more progressive views on public policy than traditional evangelical Christian voters who supported Trump in 2016.\n\nJohnnie Moore, an unofficial spokesman for the faith advisory council, was among the many pro-Trump evangelicals not invited.\n\n\"We don’t take it personally; we just pray for them,\" Moore said in a statement to CBN News. \"I’ve said it many, many times, but I’ll say it again: we have been honored to fight to protect religious liberty that even extends to protecting the rights of those who disagree with us on religious grounds, even when they are unkind.\"\n\nIn total, the meeting included about 50 faith leaders and scholars and was spearheaded by Doug Birdsall, Rev. Dr. Gabriel A. Salguero and Jenny Yang.\n\nMORE: 'Winning Power Was Judas's Goal': These Christian Leaders Pitched Pre-Trump Unity, Now, Not So Much\n\nSalguero was appointed as a member of President Obama's Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and has spoken at the Democrat National Committee Convention in the past.\n\nOther attendees included Timothy Keller, Mark Labberton and A.R. Bernard who was once a Trump evangelical advisor.",

         "Six bullets . More than I can count on one hand . That is how many times preliminary autopsy reports indicate that Michael Brown was shot . Nothing about the youthful infraction of strolling down the middle of a residential street in one ’ s own neighborhood justifies having your life ripped away from you by an irate officer firing six bullets as you face him , hands up in surrender .\nI can not even fathom what Mike , “ Big Mike ” as his friends call him , felt as each of those bullets entered his flesh . I do know a little of the rage , despair , helplessness and hopelessness that black communities have been left to feel in the aftermath of his death . I know he stayed conscious long enough to put his hands up , to try and surrender , as if to say , “ I want to live . Please don ’ t kill me . ”\nFerguson residents and protesters now find themselves arms outstretched , palms up , yelling “ don ’ t shoot , ” as police officers in guns , gas masks and tanks occupy the streets of Ferguson , Missouri , dropping canisters of tear gas on our American dreams . Those of us not yet there in Ferguson watch helplessly as the images of at least one child being tear-gassed come through our Twitter feeds , as journalists find themselves facing down the barrel of a hastily drawn police weapon or thrown in jail , as police drop stun grenades on crowds that refuse to comply with the unreasonable demand that they relinquish their right to peaceful assembly .\nWhile the world watches aghast , America ’ s penchant for exporting guns , tanks and destruction to other places in the name of law and order has shown up on our own doorsteps , in our backyards , with people pinned into parking lots and onto their porches . They are told they must stay where they are or risk being shot with rubber bullets or have their faces and lungs sting with the inhalation of tear gas .\nPublic space in Ferguson is awash in black tears , but it is the sirens that we hear wailing . The people would weep , but they are too busy running , ducking and taking cover from the angry sounds of a system that does not love them , does not care about their meager “ rights . ”\nMeanwhile , the government attempts to placate the people with optical sleights of hand . Capt . Ron Johnson , by all accounts a sincere and affable leader and head of the highway patrol , replaced the police chief late last week , with promises that he would not employ military tactics to police the citizens of Ferguson . On Thursday I breathed a bit easier as we watched him giving hugs to protesters , marching with the people , allowing black women of faith to lay hands on him and pray .\nThat peace was short-lived after the Ferguson police inflamed crowds by releasing irrelevant footage of a conflict that Michael Brown had at a local convenience store when he and his friend Dorian went to buy Cigarellos . Late that evening the crowds returned , only to be met by more tanks , more tear gas , more guns .\nBeyond shock , I continue to be appalled at the extensive lengths to which the police have gone to protect Officer Darren Wilson and his family from any public reproach or reprisal in Mike ’ s death . They delayed the release of his name in order to provide him enough time to leave town . They then released his name to coincide with video of the Cigarello incident , which they later admitted he knew nothing about when he stopped Mike . It is clear that the police are closing ranks , showing that they value the lives of their own more than the lives of citizens .\nWe are told repeatedly that police are worthy of our respect because they risk their lives each day to protect us . That is not the case for black people . When we encounter police , our lives are at risk while they protect themselves . I started to temper my statement by saying “ some police , ” but that gives the impression that I am speaking of the actions of a few rogue officers . The problem with this logic is that we now know that Ferguson law enforcement has a range of problems – disproportionate stops of black residents , disproportionately low numbers of black police ( three out of over 50 ) , and a history of antagonistic exchanges with the people of St. Louis County .\nWe have a problem of overzealous policing in this country . That problem is exacerbated by issues of race and gender , so that black men are perceived to be far more threatening than they actually are . And when black women encounter police , we are not given the protections generally afforded to white femininity . Our womanhood does not mitigate the threat of police force . This , then , is not about the actions of a rogue officer , but rather about the ideology of overpolicing that deputizes extrajudicial behavior as completely justified , as long as the life being taken or haphazardly handled is a black or brown life . Though the killing of Brown by Wilson seemingly fits a long historical script of the harassment of black people at the hands of white police officers , the reality is that overpolicing is an ideology that many police officers subscribe to regardless of color .\nThat ideology is rooted in a kind of anti-blackness that sees black bodies as a perpetual and mortal threat . Anti-black rhetoric has shown up not only from the Ferguson police but also ironically in the reporting and advocacy of everyone from CNN reporter Don Lemon to rapper Nelly , in their continued focus on issues like “ black-on-black crime ” and the necessity of keeping law and order . “ Don ’ t use your last option , first , ” Nelly told folks on St. Louis radio . There is little recognition that it is Darren Wilson who used his last option – lethal force — first . Moreover , the whole point of using tear gas and military vehicles in this small community is to force the residents into a realization that they have run out of options . Sadly , anti-black ideology can emerge even from people who are black or who otherwise love black people .\nI know Americans like to see themselves as a law and order people , but the few folks who have rioted and looted over the last few days , many of whom are reportedly not Ferguson residents , were stopped in their tracks by peaceful protesters . Even still their presence exposes an inconvenient truth . The killing of unarmed teenagers by police officers is lawlessness . It shows a lack of respect for the sanctity of life and the rule of law . The supreme irony is seeing folks defend the officer ’ s lawlessness while calling for people destroying property to respect the law .\nAs I keep saying , destruction of property is not particularly productive . But I refuse to direct my ire toward anyone but the officer who unjustly took Michael Brown ’ s life and the police establishment that is now complicit in this crime .\nI am tired . Emotionally exhausted , actually . I am tired of going to sleep each night seeing a community of people who look like me under military siege . I ’ m tired of seeing crying black mothers – Sybrina Fulton , Lucia McBath and Leslie McSpadden —distraught over the loss of their teenage sons Trayvon , Jordan and Michael . I ’ m tired of hearing report after report of people under attack from tear gas . I ’ m tired of journalists being bullied for trying to tell the truth . I ’ m tired of explaining to white people why our anger is justified , why looting , which is a property crime , should not even be part of a conversation about the killing of a teenager , why the alleged shoplifting of cigarettes is not a capital offense , why the police officer who killed Mike for the crime of walking in the street is the real thug .\nWhite racism and white privilege continue a bad cop-good cop routine with black America that is utterly exhausting . Just when we think we are making headway , a well-meaning white person asks “ but can ’ t we condemn the looting too ? ” The question is : Have you condemned the killing ? Or have you tried to explain it away ? To justify it ?\nI will not engage in a condemnation quid pro quo with trolls , well-meaning white citizens or respectable black ones , “ Brand New Negroes ” I call them , in the tradition of the famous text from Harlem Renaissance philosopher Alain Locke . I will not concede that destruction of property is equal to the taking of life . I will not answer calls to be reasonable in the face of unreasonable , unjustifiable black death . I will not believe the lie that black propriety and respectability – pulling our pants up , speaking corporate English , never , ever doing anything wrong – will save us .\nFerguson exposes the extent to which American necropolitics shapes the terms and conditions of black life in what professor Sundiata Cha-Jua calls a new racial nadir . The first racial nadir happened from about 1890 to about 1930 , when black people experienced the unprecedented loss of political gains hard won in the aftermath of the Civil War and the astronomical rise of lynching . We have indeed reached a new nadir in America ’ s racial life , one hard to fathom as a black president sits in the White House , abdicating his responsibility to speak forcefully and forthrightly to the problem of racism and military-style policing both for fear of being seen as too “ black ” and for fear of political reprisal from the right .\nMeanwhile , our voting rights have been stripped away , our kids are being killed in the streets , their killers rarely convicted , and our communities are placed under siege . And our black president reminds us that `` there are young black men who commit crime , '' though he feels no responsibility to say this about any other race of people . It 's a shaming tactic that suggests that black people do not have the right to be angry when our communities are beset with so many problems . It is the kind of anti-black thinking that suggests `` acting respectably '' will save us .\nThese are scary times . They are times for rage . Time for telling the truth . Time for ripping the band-aids off our gaping wounds . Time to recognize that we can neither heal nor fix that which we will not confront .",

I will not believe the lie that black propriety and respectability – pulling our pants up, speaking corporate English, never, ever doing anything wrong – will save us.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nFerguson exposes the extent to which American necropolitics shapes the terms and conditions of black life in what professor Sundiata Cha-Jua calls a new racial nadir. The first racial nadir happened from about 1890 to about 1930, when black people experienced the unprecedented loss of political gains hard won in the aftermath of the Civil War and the astronomical rise of lynching. We have indeed reached a new nadir in America’s racial life, one hard to fathom as a black president sits in the White House, abdicating his responsibility to speak forcefully and forthrightly to the problem of racism and military-style policing both for fear of being seen as too “black” and for fear of political reprisal from the right.\n\nMeanwhile, our voting rights have been stripped away, our kids are being killed in the streets, their killers rarely convicted, and our communities are placed under siege. And our black president reminds us that \"there are young black men who commit crime,\" though he feels no responsibility to say this about any other race of people. It's a shaming tactic that suggests that black people do not have the right to be angry when our communities are beset with so many problems. It is the kind of anti-black thinking that suggests \"acting respectably\" will save us.\n\nThese are scary times. They are times for rage. Time for telling the truth. Time for ripping the band-aids off our gaping wounds. Time to recognize that we can neither heal nor fix that which we will not confront.",

         "In an extensive article published last month that included interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement officials , congressional officials and other government employees , the New York Times published a stinging indictment of James B. Comey ’ s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe .\nThe Times made the case that Comey violated FBI tradition , bypassed the Justice Department and went rogue on several occasions in a manner that clearly impacted the 2016 presidential election .\nIn a letter on Tuesday from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired , Rosenstein specifically cited Comey ’ s alleged mishandling of the Clinton email probe as justification for Comey ’ s removal from office .\n“ I can not defend the Director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of secretary Clinton ’ s emails , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ And I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken . Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes ; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives . ”\nRosenstein continued : “ The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General ’ s authority on July 5 , 2016 , and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution . It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement . At most , the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors . ”\nThat is precisely the case made by the Times ’ April 22 article , titled , “ Comey Tried to Shield the F.B.I . From Politics . Then He Shaped an Election . ”\nThe Times says that for its article it interviewed “ more than 30 current and former law enforcement , congressional and other government officials . ”\nThe newspaper concluded that Comey ’ s decision to inform Congress that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email probe less than two weeks before the presidential election “ violate [ ed ] the policies of an agency that does not reveal its investigations or do anything that may influence an election . ”\nThe article related that Comey decided to plunge the FBI “ into the molten center of a bitter election ” in part because he feared “ the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I . had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret . ”\nA significant motivating factor for Comey ’ s rogue approach toward the Clinton email probe , the Times revealed , was his distrust of senior officials at the Justice Department , especially then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch , whom , the newspaper reported , “ Mr . Comey believed had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation . ”\nIndeed , according to the Times , Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Hillary Clinton in the email probe .\nThe FBI had further information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence , leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the U.S. government ’ s Clinton email probe , the Times reported .\nIn his letter from Tuesday , Rosenstein argues that if Comey believed Lynch to be compromised he should have sought her recusal instead of taking matters into his own hands .\n“ The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Lynch had a conflict , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department . There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General . ”\nIndeed , according to the Times , after it became clear that the F.B.I . did not discover Clinton emails showing intent to mishandle classified information – the agency believed those emails were among the correspondence deleted by Clinton – Comey made the decision to bypass the Justice Department and explain the case to the public .\nNine months into the investigation , it became clear to Mr. Comey that Mrs. Clinton was almost certainly not going to face charges . He quietly began work on talking points , toying with the notion that in the midst of a bitter presidential campaign , a Justice Department led by Democrats may not have the credibility to close the case , and that he alone should explain that decision to the public .\nComey ’ s decision was further fueled by the alleged document written by a Democratic operative hacked by the Russians , a document that in Comey ’ s view raised “ questions about [ Lynch ’ s ] independence , ” the Times reported .\nInstead of seeking Lynch ’ s recusal , as Rosenstein would later outline as the proper course of action , Comey decided to go at it alone , take matters into his own hands and make his public pronouncements about Clinton ’ s email case without the Justice Department .\nThe Times cited former Justice officials as “ deeply skeptical ” of Comey ’ s alleged reasoning :\nFormer Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account . If Mr. Comey believed that Ms. Lynch were compromised , they say , why did he not seek her recusal ? Mr. Comey never raised this issue with Ms. Lynch or the deputy attorney general , Sally Q. Yates , former officials said .\nMr. Comey ’ s defenders regard this as one of the untold stories of the Clinton investigation , one they say helps explain his decision-making . But former Justice Department officials say the F.B.I . never uncovered evidence tying Ms. Lynch to the document ’ s author , and are convinced that Mr. Comey wanted an excuse to put himself in the spotlight .\nComey ’ s decision to go rogue was solidified , according to the Times ’ account , after Lynch ’ s infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton , the husband of the FBI ’ s main subject in a criminal probe , boarded the attorney general ’ s plane and reportedly stayed there for about twenty minutes .\nYet Comey still did not seek Lynch ’ s recusal . The Times article related that after the tarmac episode , Comey “ knew for sure that when there was something to say about the case , he alone would say it . ”\nAfterwards , Comey held the press conference at which he criticized Clinton ’ s private email server as “ extremely careless ” before finally stating that “ no charges are appropriate in this case . ”\nWith his pronouncements , Comey offered judgments and legal conclusions many argue are out of the purview of the FBI , which is charged with documenting the evidence and handing it over to the Justice Department .\nThe Times cited unnamed “ frustrated ” prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them .\nComey ’ s injection into the presidential race did not end there . Less than two weeks before the election , the FBI discovered a trove of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of long-time top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin . Some of the emails , according to reports , originated on Clinton ’ s old BlackBerry server that she used before setting up her private home server and some believe may have contained the deleted messages .\nComey ’ s decision centered on whether to follow FBI tradition and keep quiet about the reopening of the case , or inform Congress about the ongoing investigation , which , the Times related , “ everyone acknowledged would create a political furor . ”\nEventually , Comey decided to go rogue again and inform Congress .\nLynch was against the decision , the Times reported , and the Justice Department implored the FBI not to impact the presidential campaign in its final days . The Times reported that “ even at the F.B.I. , agents who supported their high-profile director were stunned . ”\n“ Career prosecutors and political appointees ” at the Justice Department quietly criticized not only Comey but Lynch for failing to stop the FBI director , the Times documented .\nA chorus of former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from across the political spectrum publicly criticized Comey ’ s move . For example , Jamie S. Gorelick , who served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration , opined that Comey was “ damaging our democracy . ”\nWriting in the Washington Post on October 29 , Gorelick slammed Comey ’ s decision to so publicly reopen the case just before the election as “ antithetical to the interests of justice , putting a thumb on the scale of this election and damaging our democracy . ”\nGorelick co-authored the Washington Post opinion piece , titled , “ James Comey is damaging our democracy , ” with Larry Thompson , who served under the George W. Bush administration as deputy attorney general from 2001 to 2003 .\nGorelick ’ s piece was referenced in Rosenstein ’ s letter on Tuesday recommending that Comey be fired , writing , “ I can not defend the director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton ’ s emails . ”\nRosenstein referenced the criticism of Comey from other former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general .\nFormer Attorney General Michael Mukasey , who served under President George W. Bush , observed that the Director stepped far outside his purview in disclosing the recommendation in that fashion “ because the FBI director doesn ’ t make that decision . ”\nAlberto Gonzales , who also served as Attorney General under President George W. Bush , called the decision an error in judgment .\nEric Holder , who served as Deputy Attorney General under President Clinton and Attorney General under President Obama , said that the Director ’ s decision “ was incorrect . It violated long-standing Justice Department policies and traditions. ” Holder concluded that the Director broke with these fundamental principles and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI .\nDonald Ayer , who served as Deputy Attorney General under President George H.W . Bush , along with other former Justice Department officials , was “ astonished and perplexed ” by the decision to “ break with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections . ”\nAaron Klein is Breitbart ’ s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter .

The Times reported that “even at the F.B.I., agents who supported their high-profile director were stunned.”\n\n“Career prosecutors and political appointees” at the Justice Department quietly criticized not only Comey but Lynch for failing to stop the FBI director, the Times documented.\n\nA chorus of former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from across the political spectrum publicly criticized Comey’s move. For example, Jamie S. Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration, opined that Comey was “damaging our democracy.”\n\nWriting in the Washington Post on October 29, Gorelick slammed Comey’s decision to so publicly reopen the case just before the election as “antithetical to the interests of justice, putting a thumb on the scale of this election and damaging our democracy.”\n\nGorelick co-authored the Washington Post opinion piece, titled, “James Comey is damaging our democracy,” with Larry Thompson, who served under the George W. Bush administration as deputy attorney general from 2001 to 2003.\n\nGorelick’s piece was referenced in Rosenstein’s letter on Tuesday recommending that Comey be fired, writing, “I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails.”\n\nRosenstein referenced the criticism of Comey from other former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general.\n\nBesides Gorelick’s Post piece, Rosenstein’s letter further outlined:\n\nFormer Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who served under President George W. Bush, observed that the Director stepped far outside his purview in disclosing the recommendation in that fashion “because the FBI director doesn’t make that decision.”\n\nAlberto Gonzales, who also served as Attorney General under President George W. Bush, called the decision an error in judgment.\n\nEric Holder, who served as Deputy Attorney General under President Clinton and Attorney General under President Obama, said that the Director’s decision “was incorrect. It violated long-standing Justice Department policies and traditions.” Holder concluded that the Director broke with these fundamental principles and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI.\n\nDonald Ayer, who served as Deputy Attorney General under President George H.W. Bush, along with other former Justice Department officials, was “astonished and perplexed” by the decision to “break with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections.”\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

         "“ Trump has betrayed the Syrian Kurds ” — so goes a popular refrain regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the areas of northeast Syria held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) . The events that have followed — namely , a Turkish invasion of parts of SDF territory along the border and the deployment of Syrian government forces in some SDF areas — have been characterized as a strategic disaster for American interests , with some commentators even proclaiming the withdrawal as indicative of a U.S. imperial decline and U.S. disengagement from the Middle East .\nIn fact , much of this is overblown . For one thing , the U.S. still maintains extensive troop deployments elsewhere in the Middle East , and those are not being drawn down anytime soon . Insofar as many of the pundits , analysts , and policymakers condemning Trump consider the recent developments in Syria to be a disaster , they primarily have themselves to blame , however popular bashing Trump might be .\nIndeed , these critics of Trump did not learn the relevant lessons from December 2018 when the president ordered preparations for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria . They should have appreciated that Trump is ultimately the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces and that he had made his own preferences on Syria clear : namely , that after the military defeat of the Islamic State , U.S. forces should leave . As the president ’ s record on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal illustrates , he has generally been forthright and sincere in trying to fulfill his policy promises . When he told his advisers that he wanted to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria , he meant it . The message should have been clear : devise an orderly withdrawal plan .\nBut that is not what happened . Instead , efforts and attention were geared towards U.S. forces remaining indefinitely in Syria . The advocates for this “ stay indefinitely ” approach argued that the deployment as it existed was supposedly an example of a successful projection of U.S. leverage and influence with a relatively small number of troops . They claimed that U.S. presence was vital for political negotiations on Syria ’ s future and important for limiting Iranian influence and blocking its “ land route ” to the Mediterranean .\nIn reality , none of these assertions holds up but rather reflect dubious expansions of the original purpose of the U.S. mission in Syria : countering the Islamic State . At the same time , the “ stay indefinitely ” crowd tended to downplay the major problem regarding the U.S. partnership with the SDF : the issue of relations with Turkey , which considers ( with some justification ) the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , which has fought the Turkish state for decades .\nRegardless of what one thinks of Turkey ’ s approach towards the PKK , it is not a problem that can be treated as a minor irritant . Facts of geography mean that Turkey is located along the northern borders of the SDF ’ s territory . As such , Turkey could be the SDF ’ s main gateway to the outside world , rather than the small and limited capacity border crossing on the Tigris River that the SDF has maintained with the Iraqi Kurdistan region . Thus , for the interests of the SDF ’ s longterm economic prospects ( among other things ) , some kind of détente or resolution of the conflict between the PKK and Turkey would have been necessary so that the region could have much more open borders and engagement with the outside world .\nUnfortunately , though , policymakers and advisers did not take Turkey ’ s concerns and its threats of a military confrontation with the SDF seriously enough . Along with their desire to keep U.S. troops in Syria , many of them imagined that Turkey could somehow be appeased through half-baked measures : thus the previous attempts to deny SDF–PKK links , the failed schemes of joint U.S.–Turkish patrols in the Manbij area west of the Euphrates River , and then the joint northern border patrols and partial dismantling of SDF fortifications along the northern border with Turkey a little while before the recent Turkish incursion against the SDF .\nOthers argue that the U.S. simply needed to be adamant in saying no to a Turkish incursion and that the small U.S. troop presence could have deterred Turkey indefinitely . This view is implausible . A small foreign troop presence can function as a deterrent to another side ’ s attack , but it is not an absolute deterrent here . To understand why , consider events that occurred earlier this year on the other side of Syria . In the northwest of Syria ( specifically the city of Idlib and its environs ) , Turkey set up multiple small military outposts in the insurgent-held areas ostensibly as part of enforcing a “ deescalation ” scheme in coordination with Russia . In practice , the goal has been to block any further Syrian government offensives on the northwest and prevent further refugee flows into Turkey .\nWhile Russia has shown some understanding of Turkey ’ s concerns in this regard , it also wishes to assist the Syrian government in restoring its control over the area and will not tolerate the indefinite presence of designated “ terrorist ” groups harassing Syrian government and Russian positions . Russia thus gave Turkey time to clear a demilitarized buffer zone of the likes of Hay ’ at Tahrir al-Sham ( a designated “ terrorist ” group ) . When that did not materialize and the insurgent harassments of Syrian government and Russian positions continued , the Syrian government and Russia launched a military campaign that retook important areas in south Idlib and north Hama . The Turkish military outposts did not do anything to stop the offensive ( indeed , they could not do so ) , and in effect the Syrian government and Russia worked around one of the outposts in north Hama . A ceasefire then followed , but it should be clear that it will not last if Turkey can not crack down on the groups that are designated as “ terrorist . ”\nThat episode should also have been a lesson for U.S. policymakers . Turkey ’ s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly said he would launch an incursion against the SDF to the east of the Euphrates River ( where U.S. forces in Syria have primarily been stationed ) , and in 2018 Turkey had carried through with its threats to destroy the SDF enclave in the Afrin area , where the U.S. had no presence . What would have stopped Turkey from finding ways to work around U.S. positions as part of its incursion against the SDF east of the Euphrates River and essentially forcing the small U.S. garrisons — confronted by much larger Turkish forces and their Syrian insurgent proxies — to get out of the way ?\nThus , Trump ’ s indication to Erdoğan that he wished to leave Syria and would not oppose an incursion likely hastened the Turkish operations against the SDF . But it was not the decisive factor in determining whether or not those operations would have eventually occurred anyway . Had the U.S. wished to deter Turkey indefinitely , it would have had to deploy far more troops in northeast Syria . For comparison , the much more extensive Turkish military presence in the insurgent-held north Aleppo countryside between Afrin and Jarabulus functions as an effective deterrent against Russian and Syrian government military action so long as Turkey maintains that large presence .\nOf course , the advocates of the “ stay indefinitely ” course did not dare to confront these realities and argue for a more extensive U.S. presence , knowing that such advocacy would be politically unacceptable . They preferred to argue that the small U.S. troop presence in northeast Syria as an example of a deployment that was strategically effective and inexpensive .\nUltimately , the debate about the U.S. role in Syria boils down to the question of how far the U.S. should invest troops and resources into a foreign deployment . Those who advocated an indefinite presence are delusional if they think the prior status quo was sustainable . If they had thought more carefully about the idea of making the SDF-held areas a U.S. protectorate that could function independently of the wider environment , they should have accepted that such a project would have required far more troops and money to be poured in .\nIn any case , they should still be asked why they did not come up with an exit plan but instead thought they could defy the president ’ s wishes . They are the ones far more deserving of the accusation of betrayal for making misleading commitments , promises , and reassurances to the SDF .",

If what's already out is all there is, Mr Kushner and his lawyers have done their best to defuse the bombs. When walking in a minefield, it's the ones you don't know about that pose the greatest risk.\n\nOne matter on which Mr Kushner may face a grilling is his security clearance declaration, as he accepts he failed initially to reveal his contacts with Russians.\n\nHe says the first form, a \"rough draft that still had many omissions\", was filed by an assistant in error on 18 January and that declarations on his foreign contacts, not just with Russians, were added over the next six months \"in the normal course\".\n\nMr Kushner on his meetings with Russians:\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nAmbassador Sergei Kislyak ( above ).

         "Jim Acosta of CNN and other media personalities get exercised when the President calls Fake News the “ enemy of the people. ” President Trump does not call all news outlets or personalities by that term — only the Fake News . Certainly , that term is quite an incendiary sobriquet . The President reciprocates with it because he gets attacked with incendiary abuse . No American President in memory has been picked on and lied about with the intensity and frequency that President Trump has had to endure .\nThe media — because it is almost-monolithically Left-Democrat — regularly depicted Ronald Reagan as a moron , occasionally tying him to a movie in which he acted , Bedtime for Bonzo , where he went to bed in one scene alongside a chimpanzee . ( They forget that he was cast in the film as a university professor . ) Reagan endured it , avoided reciprocal name-calling , and history unequivocally has registered that he actually was quite brilliant , understood what so many others could not grasp , revived the moribund Jimmy Carter economy with creative strategies and tax-cutting boldness that George H.W . Bush myopically had called “ Voodoo Economics , ” stared down Mikhail Gorbachev and defeated a century of Communism , and launched an anti-ballistic military focus that his enemies mocked as “ Star Wars ” but that today is central to protecting Western democracies from incoming ballistic missiles . The “ Iron Dome ” missile-defense system that Israel has used so effectively against Gaza Hamas terrorist rockets is the fruit of “ Star Wars . ”\nThe Left Media almost universally depicted the brilliant Reagan as an idiot , and he somehow shrugged it off . Donald Trump is different because we do not manufacture our Presidents with interchangeable parts on an assembly line . It very well may be that the past week ’ s Pittsburgh terrorist attack , and the way the President responded , and the way the Left Media then hit the President viciously anyway is the “ Rosetta Stone ” — the small piece of archaeological evidence historians will need — to decipher that Donald Trump was right to call the Fake News Left Media the “ enemy of the people . ”\n1 . “ The People ” Benefit From a Robust and Independent Press — and a Fake News Regime Indeed Is the Enemy of the People\n“ The People ” indeed benefit from a robust “ press ” — more accurately called “ media ” in this digital age of televised news , digital internet-based news , and so much more than the mere newsprint “ press. ” If Stalin ’ s Soviet Russia had been covered by a robust media ( and if such media could have survived ) , “ The People ” would have learned that Stalin ’ s five-year economic plans disastrously were failing and were leading to mass starvation , moreover that he consciously was perpetrating genocide by starving millions of Ukrainians to death in the Golodomor , that he was putting millions of prisoners to work in tundra prisons to dig through ice manually to build canals and other infrastructure . An honest news media would have alerted the West , too , that Stalin was murdering millions . The New York Times had a sycophantically pro-Stalin liar , Walter Duranty , filing Fake News reports from the Soviet Union for more than ten years . The Times published the lies daily as “ news ” and made him their Moscow bureau chief for fourteen years . As a result , the West was lulled , cheated of the truth , made unaware of the evil . Yes , the Fake News indeed was the enemy of the people .\nLikewise , the New York Times— and the other mainstream media who took their lead from them — by and large refused to report on the unfolding Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews . Between 1939 and 1945 , the New York Times published more than 23,000 front-page stories . Of those , 11,500 were about World War II . Only twenty-six — in six years — were about the Holocaust . The Times was passively complicit .\nA robust newsmedia can save lives by exposing and revealing , while a Fake News regime can serve to assist in the despoiling of a people . When media foist false narratives to sow social discord , or when they assist tyranny with falsehoods , they indeed are the enemy of the people .\nSocial discord leads to streets being set on fire — witness Ferguson and Baltimore during the Obama Years . Social discord dispirits potentially valuable citizens who could help build a society , instead turning them against that society and motivating them to work towards its downfall or simply to drop out . In its worst aspect , social discord leads to armed insurrection and civil war . If the problem is that a Stalin is murdering millions by deliberately starving them while incarcerating millions others in slave camps in the Gulag , then insurrection and civil war can be righteous , potentially saving such a despoiled society . But when the society actually is doing quite well , when freedom reigns and people of all colors , creeds , religions , and ethnicities are enjoying remarkable opportunities to succeed and to live wonderfully rich and precious lives alongside their neighbors in respectful diversity , then Fake News media indeed are the enemy of the people when they seek to sow social discord in that welcome environment , aiming to up-end civil harmony .\nA maniacal dirtbag murdered eleven Jews in Pittsburgh . In time , perhaps after a decade or two of ACLU appeals , he will be electrocuted , injected , hanged , or hopefully all three . The dirtbag hated Jews , and he likewise hated President Trump . President Trump responded to the news immediately with profoundly sensitive and healing words aimed at condemning anti-Semitism and at comforting and consoling the Jewish community . Listen to his words . If the role of a President is to heal and unify , as President Reagan did after the Challenger tragedy , as President Bush did after 9-11 , then this President did so eloquently , sensitively . And then came the sowers of social discord to destroy the moment… .\nThe Left Media would not allow the President that moment to heal and unify . Instantly , they brought in one Left-Democrat anti-Trump “ analyst ” after another to blame Mr. Trump for the attack . They never blamed President Jimmy Carter ’ s anti-Jewish rhetoric for the 1977 Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue shooting in St. Louis . Nor Bill Clinton for the 1994 Brooklyn Bridge shootings of yeshiva students that included the murder of Ari Halberstam . Nor Clinton ’ s rhetoric for the 1999 Granada Hills Jewish Community Center shooting in Los Angeles . Nor Obama for the deadly 2009 Holocaust Museum shooting in Washington , D.C . Nor Obama for the 2014 Overland Park Jewish Community Center shootings in Kansas City that murdered three . But this time — with the same social dynamics as the others — they tried blaming the President . By sowing social discord with outright absolute falsehoods at a time that called for healing , the Left Media indeed were acting as enemy of the people .\nFacts are different from opinions . Facts can be discerned and evidenced . There is a reason that as many as 82 percent of Israeli Jews love President Trump , that more than 90 percent of American Orthodox Jews support President Trump . Likewise , a huge majority of British Jews — by more than three-to-one — support England ’ s conservative party and despise the Labour Socialists . Similarly , millions of Jews who have left the former Soviet Union hate Marxism and socialism , are solidly capitalist and conservative , indeed have changed the face of Israeli politics towards the more conservative Likud , now led by Benjamin Netanyahu . Throughout the world , Jews now vote conservative , are conservative — as reflected in our country , too , by American Orthodox Jews . The independent Pew Research Center has found that the Orthodox Jewish community will be the predominant Jewish community in a few decades , as the others disappear . Just as the voting patterns of the American Deep South have changed 180 degrees from Democrat to Republican in the century since the Civil War , so is the American Jewish metamorphosis now on pace to synchronize with every other Jewish community in the world that has moved towards conservatism . But Jews are not monolithic , as witness those in Hollywood and in certain media .\nSo look at what the Fake News Left Media did after President Trump healed and unified : They received a news release from a small , utterly insignificant , nothing of a Radical Leftist group , calling itself “ Bend the Arc , ” which said that they did not want the President of the United States to visit Pittsburgh . The thing is , those Radical Leftists do not want the President to visit anywhere . Just as there are rabid Leftist Catholics ( not to mention the more mainstream Leftist Nancy Pelosi , Joe Biden , and the Kennedys ) and rabid Leftist Protestants , these also are rabid Leftists . Within the normative mainstream American Jewish community , “ Bend the Arc ” is a joke , off the charts . Their CEO started off as a sex-club “ dancer. ” C ’ mon ! As reported : “ Cotler , who identifies as queer , recounted how a lesbian couple invited her to their [ event ] after she did a table dance for them at what she refers to as a ‘ sex club. ’ ” Feh !\nSo this Leftist fringe group issues their statement — and the Fake News Left Media then falsely report that “ the Jews of Pittsburgh ” ( not “ some Jews ” ) do not want the President to visit . Consider these headlines — and they are a mere sampling :\n“ ‘ You Are Not Welcome ’ : Jewish Community Leaders Do Not Want President Trump To Come To Pittsburgh ” ( Salon )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Stay Away Unless He Denounces White Nationalism ” ( NY Daily News )\n“ Trump ‘ Not Welcome ’ In Pittsburgh After Synagogue Shooting ” ( Al Jazeera )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Denounce White Nationalism ” ( Reuters )\nAll those stories thereupon cite the same insignificant radical-fringe “ Bend the Arc ” statement . Honestly — if there still is such a thing as honesty — that is outright Fake News . I know the American Jewish community . I have been a Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America , a congregational rabbi for decades , sat for six years during this past decade on the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America , have sat on committees of Jewish Federations and Boards of Hillels , have a whole lifetime résumé in this area . My rabbinical colleagues and I were bristling all day , reading and hearing this Fake News . The rabbi of the temple where the murders happened , Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers , explicitly welcomed a visit by the President . To report such lies , at a time of such intense passion , is to stoke flames among the populace . It is not unfair to call such liars “ Enemies of the People . ”\nThey do it similarly to convince Americans of Color that this President hates them . He beams so proudly that he has helped reduce poverty and unemployment in the African-American community . Likewise , in the Latino and Greater Hispanic communities . It is a hallmark of his every speech . How compare him to Hitler , for G-d ’ s sakes ? Why sow social discord between and among races when the President , despite his classical Trumpian gaffes , actually takes so much pride in his being a President for all Americans , in a country where — in his trademark line — “ we all bleed the same red , white , and blue ” ? Why denigrate his outreach to Black Americans , whether via Kanye West and Jim Brown or by speaking to a Young Black Leadership Summit ? Why begin narrating his Presidency on Day One by reporting falsely , as Zeke Miller of Time magazine did , the lie that he had removed a bust of the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office ? Why publish falsehoods to sow discord among the Black and Latino communities — if not to aim cynically to peel away their votes — by trying falsely to report that he is a bigot who hates them ? Here is a man who was in the public eye , in the world ’ s media center in the heart of Manhattan , with a weekly network television show , building skyscrapers and hotels , golf courses and casinos — all bearing his name — and no stain of racism or bigotry of such sort ever got attached to him through all those decades in the limelight . Why cause enmity and divide the nation , disillusion African Americans and Latinos from recognizing that this President seeks their advancement alongside that of everyone else ? Only to sow civil discord , to promote tension and unrest in the name of advancing an agenda that assures greater television ratings , higher advertising dollars , and a change in the elected government chosen of The People , by The People , and for The People .\n3 . The Proof the Pudding : Tagging the Most Pro-Jewish President in American History as an Anti-Semite .\nSo it comes back to the Rosetta Stone — the way the Left Media falsely portrays this President ’ s relationship with one demographic , the Jews , demonstrating a pattern of Left Media mendacity aimed at sowing social discord throughout . Even before he was elected President , the Left Media was calling him an anti-Semite by clutching at straws to prove the false narrative . Just as they did by propping up “ Bend the Arc ” into a Fake News depiction as “ Jewish Leaders , ” they regularly dig up the most irrelevant and unrepresentative people from the Far Left who are JINOs— Jews In Name Only — as “ experts ” on Trump and anti-Semitism . It does not end . These are lies , damned lies , and more damned lies being perpetuated by enemies of the people . Just consider these facts about the Trump Administration and the Jews :\nThis is an anti-Semite ? If so , may G-d smite us with an abundance of such anti-Semites ! Although his daughter , Ivanka , and son-in-law Jared Kushner are Orthodox Jews — as are their children , his grandchildren — that family connection in itself is not determinative . After all , we are told that George Soros is a Jew , and most every Jew I know would gladly trade Soros for two anti-Semites and a neo-Nazi to be named later . Soros is a major opponent of Israel and secretly funds organizations that oppose critical Israel policies . But the demonstrated life record of President Trump , a lifetime of working closely with Jews , amicably and warmly , makes him someone whom Jews throughout the world appreciate deeply . Again — every survey and poll of Jews who actually live the Jewish observances , the kosher laws , the Sabbath , the Torah demonstrates that he is warmly regarded in that community .\nThe Fake News about Trump and Jews is the Rosetta Stone . Once one cracks that hidden code , everything else becomes clear . The Left Media indeed propound Fake News , lies , and falsehoods . They undertake to stoke anger among African Americans , among Latinos , among women . The People rely on them for the news , the truth — and , yes , for honest reporting when the President is wrong because The People benefit when they are told the truth , even when the truth is not pretty . But to depict him as an agent of Putin , as a man perpetrating treason , a hater ?\nThese are the lies that come only from Enemies of the People .",
         "Jim Acosta of CNN and other media personalities get exercised when the President calls Fake News the “enemy of the people.” President Trump does not call all news outlets or personalities by that term — only the Fake News. Certainly, that term is quite an incendiary sobriquet. The President reciprocates with it because he gets attacked with incendiary abuse. No American President in memory has been picked on and lied about with the intensity and frequency that President Trump has had to endure.\n\nThe media — because it is almost-monolithically Left-Democrat — regularly depicted Ronald Reagan as a moron, occasionally tying him to a movie in which he acted, Bedtime for Bonzo, where he went to bed in one scene alongside a chimpanzee. (They forget that he was cast in the film as a university professor.) Reagan endured it, avoided reciprocal name-calling, and history unequivocally has registered that he actually was quite brilliant, understood what so many others could not grasp, revived the moribund Jimmy Carter economy with creative strategies and tax-cutting boldness that George H.W. Bush myopically had called “Voodoo Economics,” stared down Mikhail Gorbachev and defeated a century of Communism, and launched an anti-ballistic military focus that his enemies mocked as “Star Wars” but that today is central to protecting Western democracies from incoming ballistic missiles. The “Iron Dome” missile-defense system that Israel has used so effectively against Gaza Hamas terrorist rockets is the fruit of “Star Wars.”\n\nThe Left Media almost universally depicted the brilliant Reagan as an idiot, and he somehow shrugged it off. Donald Trump is different because we do not manufacture our Presidents with interchangeable parts on an assembly line. It very well may be that the past week’s Pittsburgh terrorist attack, and the way the President responded, and the way the Left Media then hit the President viciously anyway is the “Rosetta Stone” — the small piece of archaeological evidence historians will need — to decipher that Donald Trump was right to call the Fake News Left Media the “enemy of the people.”\n\n1. “The People” Benefit From a Robust and Independent Press — and a Fake News Regime Indeed Is the Enemy of the People\n\n“The People” indeed benefit from a robust “press” — more accurately called “media” in this digital age of televised news, digital internet-based news, and so much more than the mere newsprint “press.” If Stalin’s Soviet Russia had been covered by a robust media (and if such media could have survived), “The People” would have learned that Stalin’s five-year economic plans disastrously were failing and were leading to mass starvation, moreover that he consciously was perpetrating genocide by starving millions of Ukrainians to death in the Golodomor, that he was putting millions of prisoners to work in tundra prisons to dig through ice manually to build canals and other infrastructure. An honest news media would have alerted the West, too, that Stalin was murdering millions. The New York Times had a sycophantically pro-Stalin liar, Walter Duranty, filing Fake News reports from the Soviet Union for more than ten years. The Times published the lies daily as “news” and made him their Moscow bureau chief for fourteen years. As a result, the West was lulled, cheated of the truth, made unaware of the evil. Yes, the Fake News indeed was the enemy of the people.\n\nLikewise, the New York Times— and the other mainstream media who took their lead from them — by and large refused to report on the unfolding Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews. Between 1939 and 1945, the New York Times published more than 23,000 front-page stories. Of those, 11,500 were about World War II. Only twenty-six — in six years — were about the Holocaust. The Times was passively complicit.\n\nA robust newsmedia can save lives by exposing and revealing, while a Fake News regime can serve to assist in the despoiling of a people. When media foist false narratives to sow social discord, or when they assist tyranny with falsehoods, they indeed are the enemy of the people.\n\nSocial discord leads to streets being set on fire — witness Ferguson and Baltimore during the Obama Years. Social discord dispirits potentially valuable citizens who could help build a society, instead turning them against that society and motivating them to work towards its downfall or simply to drop out. In its worst aspect, social discord leads to armed insurrection and civil war. If the problem is that a Stalin is murdering millions by deliberately starving them while incarcerating millions others in slave camps in the Gulag, then insurrection and civil war can be righteous, potentially saving such a despoiled society. But when the society actually is doing quite well, when freedom reigns and people of all colors, creeds, religions, and ethnicities are enjoying remarkable opportunities to succeed and to live wonderfully rich and precious lives alongside their neighbors in respectful diversity, then Fake News media indeed are the enemy of the people when they seek to sow social discord in that welcome environment, aiming to up-end civil harmony.\n\n2. Pittsburgh: The Rosetta Stone\n\nA maniacal dirtbag murdered eleven Jews in Pittsburgh. In time, perhaps after a decade or two of ACLU appeals, he will be electrocuted, injected, hanged, or hopefully all three. The dirtbag hated Jews, and he likewise hated President Trump. President Trump responded to the news immediately with profoundly sensitive and healing words aimed at condemning anti-Semitism and at comforting and consoling the Jewish community. Listen to his words. If the role of a President is to heal and unify, as President Reagan did after the Challenger tragedy, as President Bush did after 9-11, then this President did so eloquently, sensitively. And then came the sowers of social discord to destroy the moment….\n\nThe Left Media would not allow the President that moment to heal and unify. Instantly, they brought in one Left-Democrat anti-Trump “analyst” after another to blame Mr. Trump for the attack. They never blamed President Jimmy Carter’s anti-Jewish rhetoric for the 1977 Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue shooting in St. Louis. Nor Bill Clinton for the 1994 Brooklyn Bridge shootings of yeshiva students that included the murder of Ari Halberstam. Nor Clinton’s rhetoric for the 1999 Granada Hills Jewish Community Center shooting in Los Angeles. Nor Obama for the deadly 2009 Holocaust Museum shooting in Washington, D.C. Nor Obama for the 2014 Overland Park Jewish Community Center shootings in Kansas City that murdered three. But this time — with the same social dynamics as the others — they tried blaming the President. By sowing social discord with outright absolute falsehoods at a time that called for healing, the Left Media indeed were acting as enemy of the people.\n\nFacts are different from opinions. Facts can be discerned and evidenced. There is a reason that as many as 82 percent of Israeli Jews love President Trump, that more than 90 percent of American Orthodox Jews support President Trump. Likewise, a huge majority of British Jews — by more than three-to-one — support England’s conservative party and despise the Labour Socialists. Similarly, millions of Jews who have left the former Soviet Union hate Marxism and socialism, are solidly capitalist and conservative, indeed have changed the face of Israeli politics towards the more conservative Likud, now led by Benjamin Netanyahu. Throughout the world, Jews now vote conservative, are conservative — as reflected in our country, too, by American Orthodox Jews. The independent Pew Research Center has found that the Orthodox Jewish community will be the predominant Jewish community in a few decades, as the others disappear. Just as the voting patterns of the American Deep South have changed 180 degrees from Democrat to Republican in the century since the Civil War, so is the American Jewish metamorphosis now on pace to synchronize with every other Jewish community in the world that has moved towards conservatism. But Jews are not monolithic, as witness those in Hollywood and in certain media.\n\nSo look at what the Fake News Left Media did after President Trump healed and unified: They received a news release from a small, utterly insignificant, nothing of a Radical Leftist group, calling itself “Bend the Arc,” which said that they did not want the President of the United States to visit Pittsburgh. The thing is, those Radical Leftists do not want the President to visit anywhere. Just as there are rabid Leftist Catholics (not to mention the more mainstream Leftist Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, and the Kennedys) and rabid Leftist Protestants, these also are rabid Leftists. Within the normative mainstream American Jewish community, “Bend the Arc” is a joke, off the charts. Their CEO started off as a sex-club “dancer.” C’mon! As reported: “Cotler, who identifies as queer, recounted how a lesbian couple invited her to their [event] after she did a table dance for them at what she refers to as a ‘sex club.’” Feh!\n\nSo this Leftist fringe group issues their statement — and the Fake News Left Media then falsely report that “the Jews of Pittsburgh” (not “some Jews”) do not want the President to visit. Consider these headlines — and they are a mere sampling:\n\n“‘You Are Not Welcome’: Jewish Community Leaders Do Not Want President Trump To Come To Pittsburgh” (Salon)\n\n“Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Stay Away Unless He Denounces White Nationalism” (NY Daily News)\n\n“Trump ‘Not Welcome’ In Pittsburgh After Synagogue Shooting” (Al Jazeera)\n\n“Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Denounce White Nationalism” (Reuters)\n\nAll those stories thereupon cite the same insignificant radical-fringe “Bend the Arc” statement. Honestly — if there still is such a thing as honesty — that is outright Fake News. I know the American Jewish community. I have been a Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America, a congregational rabbi for decades, sat for six years during this past decade on the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America, have sat on committees of Jewish Federations and Boards of Hillels, have a whole lifetime résumé in this area. My rabbinical colleagues and I were bristling all day, reading and hearing this Fake News. The rabbi of the temple where the murders happened, Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers, explicitly welcomed a visit by the President. To report such lies, at a time of such intense passion, is to stoke flames among the populace. It is not unfair to call such liars “Enemies of the People.”\n\nThey do it similarly to convince Americans of Color that this President hates them. He beams so proudly that he has helped reduce poverty and unemployment in the African-American community. Likewise, in the Latino and Greater Hispanic communities. It is a hallmark of his every speech. How compare him to Hitler, for G-d’s sakes? Why sow social discord between and among races when the President, despite his classical Trumpian gaffes, actually takes so much pride in his being a President for all Americans, in a country where — in his trademark line — “we all bleed the same red, white, and blue”? Why denigrate his outreach to Black Americans, whether via Kanye West and Jim Brown or by speaking to a Young Black Leadership Summit? Why begin narrating his Presidency on Day One by reporting falsely, as Zeke Miller of Time magazine did, the lie that he had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office? Why publish falsehoods to sow discord among the Black and Latino communities — if not to aim cynically to peel away their votes — by trying falsely to report that he is a bigot who hates them? Here is a man who was in the public eye, in the world’s media center in the heart of Manhattan, with a weekly network television show, building skyscrapers and hotels, golf courses and casinos — all bearing his name — and no stain of racism or bigotry of such sort ever got attached to him through all those decades in the limelight. Why cause enmity and divide the nation, disillusion African Americans and Latinos from recognizing that this President seeks their advancement alongside that of everyone else? Only to sow civil discord, to promote tension and unrest in the name of advancing an agenda that assures greater television ratings, higher advertising dollars, and a change in the elected government chosen of The People, by The People, and for The People.\n\n3. The Proof the Pudding: Tagging the Most Pro-Jewish President in American History as an Anti-Semite.\n\nSo it comes back to the Rosetta Stone — the way the Left Media falsely portrays this President’s relationship with one demographic, the Jews, demonstrating a pattern of Left Media mendacity aimed at sowing social discord throughout.

They undertake to stoke anger among African Americans, among Latinos, among women.

But to depict him as an agent of Putin, as a man perpetrating treason, a hater?\n\nThese are the lies that come only from Enemies of the People.",

         "ALEXANDRIA , Va. ( ███ ) - Rick Gates , a longtime business associate of U.S. President Donald Trump ’ s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort , on Monday testified that he helped Manafort file false tax returns and hide his foreign bank accounts .\nGates is the government ’ s star witness in its case against Manafort , who is accused of bank and tax fraud . Gates , who also served on Trump ’ s campaign , pleaded guilty in February and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors under a deal that could lead to a reduced sentence .\nTaking the stand on the trial ’ s fifth day , Gates admitted to helping Manafort doctor financial statements , hide foreign income and cheat on his taxes . He said he was aware Manafort was acting as an unregistered foreign agent in lobbying for Ukraine . He said he engaged in the wrongdoing at Manafort ’ s direction .\n“ At Mr. Manafort ’ s request we did not disclose foreign bank accounts , ” Gates told the jury in federal court in Alexandria , Virginia .\nManafort ’ s defense hinges on pinning the blame on Gates , who they accuse of embezzling millions of dollars from Manafort .\nGates , who first met Manafort working for him as an intern fresh out of college , has been described by witnesses as Manafort ’ s right-hand man in his multimillion-dollar political consulting business .\nThroughout his testimony , Gates largely avoided making eye contact with Manafort , who appeared to be watching him .\nIn addition to assisting in Manafort ’ s alleged crimes , Gates told the jury he had failed to report income he routed through his bank accounts in the United Kingdom and said he stole several hundreds of thousands of dollars from Manafort by filing false and inflated expense reports .\nThose admissions are likely to become a focal point for Manafort ’ s defense team when he is cross examined on Tuesday .\nManafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts . The charges largely predate his five months on the Trump campaign . His case is the first to go to trial arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election .\nThe jury has heard how Manafort made tens of millions of dollars for work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine . Mueller is also investigating possible coordination between Trump campaign members and Russian officials in the election campaign , but the charges against Manafort do not address that .\nFormer Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort is shown in a court room sketch , during a testimony of a longtime business associate Rick Gates ( not shown ) , on the fifth day of his trial , on bank and tax fraud charges stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , in federal court in Alexandria , Virginia , U.S. , August 6 , 2018 . Judge T.S .

         "ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - Rick Gates, a longtime business associate of U.S. President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, on Monday testified that he helped Manafort file false tax returns and hide his foreign bank accounts.\n\nGates is the government’s star witness in its case against Manafort, who is accused of bank and tax fraud. Gates, who also served on Trump’s campaign, pleaded guilty in February and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors under a deal that could lead to a reduced sentence.\n\nTaking the stand on the trial’s fifth day, Gates admitted to helping Manafort doctor financial statements, hide foreign income and cheat on his taxes. He said he was aware Manafort was acting as an unregistered foreign agent in lobbying for Ukraine. He said he engaged in the wrongdoing at Manafort’s direction.\n\n“At Mr. Manafort’s request we did not disclose foreign bank accounts,” Gates told the jury in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nManafort’s defense hinges on pinning the blame on Gates, who they accuse of embezzling millions of dollars from Manafort.\n\nGates, who first met Manafort working for him as an intern fresh out of college, has been described by witnesses as Manafort’s right-hand man in his multimillion-dollar political consulting business.\n\nThroughout his testimony, Gates largely avoided making eye contact with Manafort, who appeared to be watching him.\n\nIn addition to assisting in Manafort’s alleged crimes, Gates told the jury he had failed to report income he routed through his bank accounts in the United Kingdom and said he stole several hundreds of thousands of dollars from Manafort by filing false and inflated expense reports.\n\nThose admissions are likely to become a focal point for Manafort’s defense team when he is cross examined on Tuesday.\n\nManafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. The charges largely predate his five months on the Trump campaign. His case is the first to go to trial arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nThe jury has heard how Manafort made tens of millions of dollars for work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Mueller is also investigating possible coordination between Trump campaign members and Russian officials in the election campaign, but the charges against Manafort do not address that.\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort is shown in a court room sketch, during a testimony of a longtime business associate Rick Gates (not shown), on the fifth day of his trial, on bank and tax fraud charges stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, U.S., August 6, 2018.

         "Last week , Creshuna Miles , Juror No . 8 in the Michael Dunn trial , gave an interview to CNN about the jury ’ s partial verdict . Although she believes that Michael Dunn is guilty of second-degree murder , a lesser charge for which the jury had the option to convict , she insisted that the case was “ not about race , ” that it never came up . Moreover , she believed Michael Dunn to be essentially “ a good guy , ” who made “ bad choices . ”\nStartlingly , she also indicated that until Dunn ran down the street chasing Jordan ’ s three friends , she actually believed that Dunn acted in self-defense .\nPost-racial thinking is insidious not only because it gives lie to the very real and continuing material consequences of racism in this country , but also because it seduces young , optimistic , idealistic black youth into identifying with the very systems and people who would kill them without a second thought -- and then go order a pizza and a take a nap .\nPart of what Miles ’ impressions of Dunn reveal is that the defense did a far better job of humanizing Dunn for the jury than the prosecution did of humanizing Jordan for the jury .\nBut her impressions also reveal a deep disidentification with the seemingly retrograde racial politics that informed Dunn ’ s fatal engagement with Jordan Davis . Those 20th century-style racial politics take as a given that a group of young black men listening to rap music must be up to no good and that white harm is imminent .\nSuch thinking seems not to fit the cosmopolitan , progressive 21st century narrative of multiracial acceptance that ideological post-racialism pretends to be .\nI know that jury selection is a strategy . And I know Creshuna Miles was picked because she is a black woman whose political views seem to be able to lay race to the side , even when it is so glaringly obvious .\nHad Jordan Davis been white , he would still be alive . Maybe Michael Dunn would have yelled at a white Jordan Davis for bumping rap music , but he absolutely would not have perceived such a kid to be a threat or the playing of rap music loud enough to constitute a capital offense .\nCreshuna Miles came to a right decision , and wanted to convict Michael Dunn of some form of murder . But her fervent belief that the case was “ about justice , ” not “ about race , ” misses a fundamental truth about American society . Justice and injustice in this country are inextricable from racial politics . Racial politics determine everything from who gets arrested to who gets convicted , the harshness of the sentences they ’ ll serve , and the quality of legal representation they ’ ll have .\nMoreover , Creshuna Miles is not just a black woman . She is a big , dark-skinned black woman , who rocks honey blond highlights in her hair . Her unmistakable , inescapable , culturally ethnic blackness is part of the unspoken but visual narrative of this trial . Just as Michael Dunn came upon a car and visually assessed threat based upon the color of the young men inside , the visuality of Creshuna Miles ’ body absolutely influences how her testimony is understood .\nIn some ways Miles is a perfect foil for Rachel Jeantel . In Jeantel ’ s post-Zimmerman trial interview , she discounted a juror who claimed race hadn ’ t mattered in the trial , telling Piers Morgan , “ Let ’ s be honest . It ’ s racial. ” In this case , Creshuna Miles , just one year older than and visually similar to Rachel , comes along and says just the opposite . In both cases , black America saw the bodies of these two women and cringed . Internalized self-hatred coupled with violent conditions for black men is always a dangerous brew for black women . So I have been less compelled to jump on the `` critique Creshuna '' bandwagon , because so much of it is rooted in the unreasonable expectations that we have for black women to know how to outwit a system that is designed to work against not just black men , but us , too . Still I see Rachel and Creshuna and a certain knowing emerges for me .\nI know that when you live your life in an unmistakably big black body , of the type that Rachel , Creshuna and I share , a body that is often seen as aggressive and threatening , two types of coping strategies emerge . One is a kind of aggressive embrace of one ’ s own blackness and a refusal to take any shit . That seems like how Rachel rolls . The other relies on a rejection of the truth about race as a form of triumph over the impenetrability of racial discourse . In other words , maybe Creshuna Miles felt more intelligent and progressive , by taking a contrarian position , by not holding the views that people assumed that she , as a black person , would hold .\nGiven her particular kind of black embodiment , Creshuna Miles ’ decision carries great weight in an American populace that deeply wants to believe in the myth of a colorblind system . The problem here – the lie of post-racialism , to be more precise – is that Miles ’ rejection of the racial elements of this case hold more weight precisely because she is a black woman . Essentially , finding the biggest and blackest of black women to say that there was no miscarriage of justice in this case helps assuage any white guilt .\nI ’ m not angry with Creshuna Miles . But I know her thinking , uninformed as it is , is dangerous . I know the justice system relies on the willing racial performativity of black people who are willing to discount the importance of race in matters such as these . Much like patriarchy requires the complicity and willing participation of women to continue , racism requires the complicity and willing , if unwitting , participation of black and people of color to continue .\nI ’ m deeply bothered by the fact that she does not seemingly understand the way in which her body was used against her . That she felt compelled as a black woman in the case to come out and insist on all the ways that it wasn ’ t about race suggests how deeply it is about race . Florida ’ s justice system pimped Creshuna Miles for her body type and flawed perspective . Her identification with Dunn is the flip side of the same kind of logic that got Trayvon and Jordan killed . She failed to recognize that she was on the jury and appealing to the media precisely because she reads as everything Dunn is not . She might see the justice system as colorblind , but it absolutely would not see her in the same ways . Everyone sees her color . By the same token , Trayvon , Jordan , Rachel and even Marcus Smart all believed they could engage white people who approached them combatively on equal or similar terms .\nWhen Zimmerman confronted and questioned Trayvon , Trayvon talked back and then fought back . When the Zimmerman defense team goaded Rachel Jeantel on the stand , she served up a healthy helping of visible disdain . When Michael Dunn confronted Jordan and his friends , they all verbally resisted his “ instruction ” and command that they turn down the music .\nThese young black folks have not fully reckoned with what it means to occupy a completely different social position than the white people who confronted them and demanded various forms of compliance . One set of social positions has legal protection and the right to armed self-defense . The other social position requires deference and the eschewing of all aggression in order to be believed and protected – and in order to stay among the living .\nJordan , Trayvon and Rachel never perfected the fine art of respectable resistance . And because I am deeply resistant to respectability politics on principle , I ’ m not sure they should . But the death and tragedy these young people have endured reminds me of why our ancestors frequently turned to respectable forms of resistance as a form of survival .\nWhen I look at Creshuna Miles , it is clear to me that her racial analysis is far more akin to that of her peers than different . All of these young people want to believe that they have the right to assert themselves and their rights and priorities in the same ways that white men retain the prerogative to do . Through the most brutal of lessons , they continue to learn differently .\nI hope Creshuna Miles learns differently . I remind myself that she is only 21 and that she did vote to convict . But racial innocence won ’ t serve her well . I hope she knows that she was chosen as a juror because of the combination of her black body and her whitewashed racial views , not despite them . And I hope time gently rather than harshly teaches her that post-racialism won ’ t protect her from her own blackness any more than it protected Jordan .",

Those 20th century-style racial politics take as a given that a group of young black men listening to rap music must be up to no good and that white harm is imminent.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSuch thinking seems not to fit the cosmopolitan, progressive 21st century narrative of multiracial acceptance that ideological post-racialism pretends to be.\n\nI know that jury selection is a strategy. And I know Creshuna Miles was picked because she is a black woman whose political views seem to be able to lay race to the side, even when it is so glaringly obvious.\n\nHad Jordan Davis been white, he would still be alive. Maybe Michael Dunn would have yelled at a white Jordan Davis for bumping rap music, but he absolutely would not have perceived such a kid to be a threat or the playing of rap music loud enough to constitute a capital offense.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nCreshuna Miles came to a right decision, and wanted to convict Michael Dunn of some form of murder. But her fervent belief that the case was “about justice,” not “about race,” misses a fundamental truth about American society. Justice and injustice in this country are inextricable from racial politics. Racial politics determine everything from who gets arrested to who gets convicted, the harshness of the sentences they’ll serve, and the quality of legal representation they’ll have.\n\nMoreover, Creshuna Miles is not just a black woman. She is a big, dark-skinned black woman, who rocks honey blond highlights in her hair. Her unmistakable, inescapable, culturally ethnic blackness is part of the unspoken but visual narrative of this trial. Just as Michael Dunn came upon a car and visually assessed threat based upon the color of the young men inside, the visuality of Creshuna Miles’ body absolutely influences how her testimony is understood.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIn some ways Miles is a perfect foil for Rachel Jeantel. In Jeantel’s post-Zimmerman trial interview, she discounted a juror who claimed race hadn’t mattered in the trial, telling Piers Morgan, “Let’s be honest. It’s racial.” In this case, Creshuna Miles, just one year older than and visually similar to Rachel, comes along and says just the opposite. In both cases, black America saw the bodies of these two women and cringed. Internalized self-hatred coupled with violent conditions for black men is always a dangerous brew for black women. So I have been less compelled to jump on the \"critique Creshuna\" bandwagon, because so much of it is rooted in the unreasonable expectations that we have for black women to know how to outwit a system that is designed to work against not just black men, but us, too. Still I see Rachel and Creshuna and a certain knowing emerges for me.\n\nI know that when you live your life in an unmistakably big black body, of the type that Rachel, Creshuna and I share, a body that is often seen as aggressive and threatening, two types of coping strategies emerge. One is a kind of aggressive embrace of one’s own blackness and a refusal to take any shit. That seems like how Rachel rolls. The other relies on a rejection of the truth about race as a form of triumph over the impenetrability of racial discourse. In other words, maybe Creshuna Miles felt more intelligent and progressive, by taking a contrarian position, by not holding the views that people assumed that she, as a black person, would hold.\n\nGiven her particular kind of black embodiment, Creshuna Miles’ decision carries great weight in an American populace that deeply wants to believe in the myth of a colorblind system. The problem here – the lie of post-racialism, to be more precise – is that Miles’ rejection of the racial elements of this case hold more weight precisely because she is a black woman. Essentially, finding the biggest and blackest of black women to say that there was no miscarriage of justice in this case helps assuage any white guilt.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI’m not angry with Creshuna Miles. But I know her thinking, uninformed as it is, is dangerous. I know the justice system relies on the willing racial performativity of black people who are willing to discount the importance of race in matters such as these. Much like patriarchy requires the complicity and willing participation of women to continue, racism requires the complicity and willing, if unwitting, participation of black and people of color to continue.\n\nI’m deeply bothered by the fact that she does not seemingly understand the way in which her body was used against her. That she felt compelled as a black woman in the case to come out and insist on all the ways that it wasn’t about race suggests how deeply it is about race. Florida’s justice system pimped Creshuna Miles for her body type and flawed perspective. Her identification with Dunn is the flip side of the same kind of logic that got Trayvon and Jordan killed. She failed to recognize that she was on the jury and appealing to the media precisely because she reads as everything Dunn is not. She might see the justice system as colorblind, but it absolutely would not see her in the same ways. Everyone sees her color. By the same token, Trayvon, Jordan, Rachel and even Marcus Smart all believed they could engage white people who approached them combatively on equal or similar terms.\n\nWhen Zimmerman confronted and questioned Trayvon, Trayvon talked back and then fought back. When the Zimmerman defense team goaded Rachel Jeantel on the stand, she served up a healthy helping of visible disdain. When Michael Dunn confronted Jordan and his friends, they all verbally resisted his “instruction” and command that they turn down the music.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThese young black folks have not fully reckoned with what it means to occupy a completely different social position than the white people who confronted them and demanded various forms of compliance. One set of social positions has legal protection and the right to armed self-defense. The other social position requires deference and the eschewing of all aggression in order to be believed and protected – and in order to stay among the living.\n\nJordan, Trayvon and Rachel never perfected the fine art of respectable resistance. And because I am deeply resistant to respectability politics on principle, I’m not sure they should. But the death and tragedy these young people have endured reminds me of why our ancestors frequently turned to respectable forms of resistance as a form of survival.\n\nWhen I look at Creshuna Miles, it is clear to me that her racial analysis is far more akin to that of her peers than different. All of these young people want to believe that they have the right to assert themselves and their rights and priorities in the same ways that white men retain the prerogative to do. Through the most brutal of lessons, they continue to learn differently.\n\nI hope Creshuna Miles learns differently. I remind myself that she is only 21 and that she did vote to convict. But racial innocence won’t serve her well. I hope she knows that she was chosen as a juror because of the combination of her black body and her whitewashed racial views, not despite them. And I hope time gently rather than harshly teaches her that post-racialism won’t protect her from her own blackness any more than it protected Jordan.",

         "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on , though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question . So now , in order to preserve the broader framework — in which , for example , that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order , and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley .\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position , and the temporizing of others around her , I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done . There is still fierce opposition in some nearby quarters to what she has done , and she showed some degree of moral leadership when she called for state law to be quickly changed , so that the battle flag could be taken down . Yet , it ’ s equally clear that she has framed her argument well within the historical tradition of Southern white supremacist ideology — not in the heart of that tradition , to be sure , but still within the stifling folds of its garments .\nFor many people in our state the flag stands for traditions that are noble — traditions of history , of heritage , and of ancestry . The hate-filled murderer who massacred our brothers and sisters in Charleston has a sick and twisted view of the flag . In no way does he reflect the people in our state who respect and in many ways revere it . Those South Carolinians view the flag as a symbol of respect , integrity and duty . They also see it as a memorial , a way to honor ancestors who came to the service of their state during time of conflict . That is not hate . Nor is it racism .\nIn short , Dylann Roof messed things up for all the rest of us , so — unfortunately — things have to change . Implicitly , that ’ s the real bottom line . Haley continued , with a brief nod to the obvious , before hurrying on :\nAt the same time , for many others in South Carolina , the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past . As a state , we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints . We do not need to declare a winner and a loser here .\nAnd so she declared a truce — the truce of false equivalency — as the pathway forward :\nWe respect freedom of expression . And that for those who wish to show their respect for the flag on their private property , no one will stand in your way . But the statehouse is different . And the events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way .\nThe willingness to change is easy to grab onto and praise , but the more troubling aspects , the multiple ways in which change — not to mention simple justice — are more challenging to properly grasp , identify and name , much less come to terms with . At least three starting points can easily be identified , however . The first came from Ta-Nehisi Coates . Honing in on the underlying claim that Roof 's views did not reflect those of South Carolinians more broadly , Coates quickly weighed in to say :\nIf the governor meant that very few of the flag ’ s supporters believe in mass murder , she is surely right . But on the question of whose view of the Confederate Flag is more twisted , she is almost certainly wrong . Roof ’ s belief that black life had no purpose beyond subjugation is “ sick and twisted ” in the exact same manner as the beliefs of those who created the Confederate flag were “ sick and twisted. ” The Confederate flag is directly tied to the Confederate cause , and the Confederate cause was white supremacy .\nThis is the plain historical reality , and Coates goes on to rolls out stanza after stanza in an impressive historical litany of authoritative voices repeatedly underscoring the point , beginning with the Confederate states ’ own explanations for war , starting with South Carolina , then Mississippi ( which was particularly blunt : “ Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world. ” ) , Louisiana , Alabama ( “ the election of Mr. Lincoln can not be regarded otherwise than … an open declaration of war ” ) and Texas .\nHe then goes on to quote notable individuals , such as Jefferson Davis , not only affirming the centrality of slavery to the Southern cause , but elaborating on their desire to extend slaveholding into Cuba , Mexico and elsewhere , as well as propounding their belief that the equality of white men was founded on the slavery of blacks , and thus would be irrevocably lost if slavery were to be abolished . Thus , white supremacy for the South was not simply an isolated belief in the inherent superiority of whites as a race , it was the foundation for an aggressive and self-styled “ progressive ” worldview , a whole self-contained system of thought . The flag is inextricably linked to all of that .\nAs a second starting point it ’ s also true that the Confederate battle flag was largely a relic until it was revived in response to the Civil Rights Movement — first with Strom Thurmond ’ s “ States Rights Party ” in 1948 , then with Georgia adopting a version in protest of Brown v. Board of Education in 1956 , and South Carolina six years later — though , tellingly , the flag went up a year before the act authorizing it . For almost a hundred years , the South got on just fine celebrating its heritage without benefit of the flag . Indeed , the flag was raised over South Carolina as a result of the Civil War centennial celebration . This revival of interest in the flag was clearly all about renewed defiance of the federal government , which was finally being prodded into making good on the Civil War Amendments , and ensuring the full citizenship of African-Americans . Hence , today , the “ heritage ” the flag actually stands for is that of the 1960s , not the 1860s . Good luck with that .\nA third , related point , made by Jeet Heer at the New Republic , is that the flag matters tremendously as exertion of raw power . Its reintroduction in response to the Civil Rights movement sent a clear message : “ The feds might try to help you , but remember who is the boss down here . We still rule. ” Flying everywhere throughout the South , it sends the constant message to black Southerners , that they are not safe , they are not in control of their own personal security , much less anything else . Whatever other stories Southern whites might tell themselves and others about the flag , this basic fact remains . Indeed , the rhetorical act of denying the flag ’ s white supremacist meaning only demonstrates further how completely whites control things .\nBeyond these three starting points , there ’ s a vast terrain to explore , in terms of the white supremacist legacy the flag stands for and how it has reshaped itself over time . There are at least four key elements that any such account would have to explore . First , is the matter of white supremacy itself as a matter of organized social policy — both in terms of what it supports ( slavery in one era , segregation in the next , etc . ) and what it opposes ( abolition , integration , “ big government ” ) — as well as the culture it both depends upon and reproduces . Second , is the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to another , both establishing purportedly new foundations , while simultaneously reinterpreting the past .\nIt originally expressed itself in terms of slavery , then segregation and now largely in terms of what sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva described as “ colorblind racism ” in his book `` Racism Without Racists : Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America . '' Third , is the way in which white supremacy naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against . Bonilla-Silva ’ s book has a great deal to say about this as well . Furthermore , the pretense that the battle flag represents Civil War-era heritage rather than Civil Rights-era hatred is a telling example of how this process unfolds . Fourth , is the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance , etc . Haley leaned very heavily on this aspect of white supremacy in the process of pretending to reject it . So let us briefly consider each of these in turn .\nFirst , let ’ s reflect on white supremacy as a matter of organized social policy . There is nothing particularly difficult for people today to look back on past forms of white supremacy and reject them . It ’ s easy nowadays to see slavery or segregation as evil . Even Rand Paul , defending segregation in principle , said it was a bad business decision . But what about white supremacy policies today ?\nWhile part of the impetus to remove the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina came from respect for the Rev . Clementa Pinckney , the long-serving , highly respected member of the South Carolina State Senate , this only scratched the surface of Pinckney ’ s politics , as pointed out by North Carolina NAACP leader the Rev . William Barber on Democracy Now ! recently :\nReverend Pinckney , as a colleague in ministry , was not just opposed to the flag , he was opposed to the denial of Medicaid expansion , where now the majority of the state is opposing Medicaid expansion where six out of 10 black people live . He was opposed to voter suppression , voter ID in South Carolina . He was opposed to those who have celebrated the ending of the Voting Rights Act , or the gutting of Section 4 , which means South Carolina is no longer a preclearance state , and the very district that he served in is vulnerable right now . He was opposed to the lack of funding for public education . He wanted to see living wages raised .\nEvery item Barber mentioned is felt more deeply by the black community , so it ’ s not hard to grasp what a true rejection of white supremacy would look like . One might say that this calls for “ activist government , ” but the white South was all in favor of activist government `` When Affirmative Action Was White , '' as Ira Katznelson ’ s 2006 book explained . Thus , Barber continued :\nSo I would say to my colleagues , let ’ s take down the flag — to the governor — but also , let ’ s put together an omnibus bill in the name of the nine martyrs . And all of the things Reverend Pinckney was standing for , if we say we love him and his colleagues , let ’ s put all of those things in a one big omnibus bill and pass that and bring it to the funeral on Friday or Saturday , saying we will expand Medicaid to help not only black people , but poor white Southerners in South Carolina , because it ’ s not just the flag . Lee Atwater talked about the Southern strategy , where policy was used as a way to divide us . And if we want harmony , we have to talk about racism , not just in terms of symbol , but in the substance of policies . The flag went up to fight policies . If we ’ re going to bring it down , we ’ re also going to have to change policies , and particularly policies that create disparate impact on black , brown and poor white people .\nThe phrase “ disparate impact , ” which Barber used , is key to how white supremacy operates in the post-segregation era . It ’ s not that the races are treated entirely differently , only that the odds , burdens , privileges and benefits change , depending on the color of your skin . Often this happens without any conscious awareness , which is why Bonilla-Silva ’ s phrase , “ racism without racists ” is so apt . This is really not difficult to grasp — unless you ’ ve got a vested interest in not grasping it . In which case , welcome to the world of our second topic , the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to the next , and how\nTransitions between eras are often abrupt in some respects — the swift abolition of slavery in the final years of the Civil War , for example — while taking decades to work out in other ways . In order to first establish , and then fully stabilize the segregationist era , the meaning and purpose of the Civil War itself had to be reinterpreted through a white supremacist lens . The story of how that transpired over a fifty-year period is the subject of `` Race and Reunion : The Civil War in American Memory '' by David W. Blight . As I summarized in my review :\nBlight explains three broad visions of Civil War memory - reconciliationist , emancipationist and white supremacist . The first was born in wartime responses to its terrible brutality , epitomized by Walt Whitman 's experience of tending the wounded and dying of both sides . The second sprang not just from the war , but also from the Emancipation Proclamation and the more than 200,000 black combatants who joined the fight . The third gradually reformulated itself after the shock of military defeat , eventually dominating reconciliationist thinking by sacrificing racial reconciliation for the sake of sectional reunion .\nIt was not surprising that the reconciliationist view came to dominate — politically , materially , the nation needed sectional reintegration in a much more immediate way than it needed anything for its black citizens — a calculus that would eventually change over time . What ’ s striking is the relative ease with which the white supremacist vision came to merge with and dominate the reconciliationist view .\nThis is not the exception , but the rule in American history : any moves toward reconciling differences inevitably become infected with white supremacist aims — unless , of course , they are founded on them to begin with , as the case with American Colonization Society and the movement surrounding it , more on that below . A similar process has taken place with the end of segregation and the discrediting of overt racism which the norm in that era throughout the South , as well as in much of the North . This is essence of what Bonilla-Silva reveals in `` Racism Without Racists '' : a set of beliefs has emerged with superficially broad appeal , but which harbors a “ hidden ” white supremacist impact . Bonilla-Silva identifies four central frames at the core of colorblind racism : `` The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information , '' Bonilla-Silva writes . The first — and what I take to be the most significant and distinctive frame — is “ abstract liberalism , ” which he explains as follows :\nThe frame of abstract liberalism involves using ideas associated with political liberalism ( e.g . `` equal opportunity , '' the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy ) and economic liberalism ( e.g. , choice , individualism ) in an abstract manner to explain racial matters .\nWhat abstract liberalism hides is virtually everything having to do with history and indeed all social science , outside the narrow framework of market economics . It hides all historical inequalities , which recent research suggests persists for as long as ten generations . It also hides subconscious racial preferences , which can create intense segregation without any overt centralized coercion . But above all , it creates the illusion of some idealized social order , which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “ reverse racism. ” In short , the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them : they are the “ real racists , ” not whites !\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles , but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone . These are “ naturalization , ” which “ allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences , ” “ cultural racism ” which “ relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘ Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education ’ or ‘ blacks have too many babies ’ to explain the standing of minorities in society ” and “ minimization of racism ” which “ suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities ' life chances ( ‘ It 's better now than in the past ’ or ‘ There is discrimination , but there are plenty of jobs out there ’ ) . ” All three of these frames have been used in past eras . For example , Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past , so segregation was something blacks could and should accept . Similarly , cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism . But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today .\nAs I indicated above , not only does Bonilla-Silva ’ s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another , it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “ naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against. ” Indeed , this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “ common sense ” emerges , responding to multiple different needs at once , most typically , a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible , and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible . The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude , even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact . Meanwhile , those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order , even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics .\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic , the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance and so forth . It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else , and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done . Not only does white supremacy lay down the law , if conflicts arise in response , white supremacy takes the lead in naming , identifying and analyzing them , leading to proposed white supremacist solutions . On a macro scale , this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale , from the lowliest parts on up to the whole .\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society . It was originally founded to bring together two politically disparate groups , Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders , both united by the belief that free blacks faced a miserable future in America , and would be better off in Africa . This granddaddy of all “ grand bargains ” was laughable on its face — there hundreds of thousands of free blacks , far more than could ever be returned to Africa , even if they had all wanted to go — which most emphatically did not . But it was extremely popular with political elites , precisely because of its centrist power to “ bring people together ” — white people , that is . In his book , `` Of One Blood : Abolitionism and the Origins of Racial Equality , '' historian Paul Goodman had this to say :\nBy 1817 , African colonization had become more than a speculative idea . In the next decade , hundreds of prominent Americans -- political leaders including Presidents Madison and Monroe and religious leaders in most of the large denominations , from Presbyterian Lyman Beecher of Massachusetts to Episcopalian bishop William Mead of Virginia—threw their prestige and influence behind the America Colonization Society ( ACS ) , which established the colony of Liberia in West Africa . One of the most impressive voluntary societies of its day , the ACS boasted over two hundred state and local auxiliaries by 1830 . It was quietly assisted by President Monroe and endorsed by state legislatures and the major religious denominations , as well as by an illustrious panoply of notables .\nAs Goodman goes on to describe , the 19th-Century abolitionist movement was born out of free blacks ’ opposition to the ACS . It was precisely their unwillingness to be “ reasonable ” which formed the foundation of resistance which eventually spread to white abolitionists , and over a period five decades , eventually resulted in emancipation . Yet , almost up until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation he himself continued to be a supporter of colonization — such was the power of this “ centrist ” white supremacist vision . In fact , the ACS lived on for almost 100 years after Lincoln ’ s death — it only shut down in 1964 !\nThere are many other instances in which the cause of black freedom only advanced by refusing to be “ reasonable ” or to live up to some purported virtue or another . That ’ s because white supremacy , in one form or another , has always had such an enormous say in dictating what it meant to be “ reasonable ” or virtuous . And so it ’ s been incumbent on blacks to learn to think outside the box — to find a broader framework of understanding on which to found their moral as well as their political analysis .\nThis is why Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , once spoke to the American Psychological Association , and came out proudly for the cause of what he called “ creative maladjustment ” :\nI am sure that we will recognize that there are some things in our society , some things in our world , to which we should never be adjusted . There are some things concerning which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will . We must never adjust ourselves to racial discrimination and racial segregation . We must never adjust ourselves to religious bigotry . We must never adjust ourselves to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few . We must never adjust ourselves to the madness of militarism , and the self-defeating effects of physical violence… . Thus , it may well be that our world is in dire need of a new organization , The International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment .\nSimilarly , King ’ s “ Letter From Birmingham Jail ” was all about rejecting the framework of passive , superficial words of peace , moderation and restraint which the white ministers of Birmingham sought to impose on him . Here is just a small section of the wisdom it contains :\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress . I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace , in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight , to a substantive and positive peace , in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality . Actually , we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension . We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive . We bring it out in the open , where it can be seen and dealt with .\nI could not help myself thinking about the profound wrong-headed of “ reasonable ” white supremacy as I heard Nikki Haley ’ s speech , which is why my enthusiasm for it was so dimmed . In perhaps her most deeply typical move , she said there didn ’ t have to be winners and losers . Folks who love the flag and folks who despise it can all get along just fine ! But , of course , that leaves the entire substantive agenda Reverend Barber spoke about dead on arrival — just as it was supposed to do . There is no real underlying intent to address and disown the evil of white supremacy . The only way that evil is faced is by projecting it onto the disowned Confederate son , Dylann Roof .\nA good way to understand what ’ s wrong with Haley ’ s speech is to compare it with a speech by a quintessential white Southerner , Strom Thurmond ’ s son , whose speech makes no such attempt to defend the blind worship of “ heritage. ” Here is what South Carolina State Senator Paul Thurmond said :\nI am aware of my heritage . But my appreciation for the things that my forebearers accomplished to make my life better doesn ’ t mean that I must believe that they always made the right decisions and , for the life of me , I will never understand how anyone could fight a civil war based , in part , on the desire to continue the practice of slavery . Think about it for just a second . Our ancestors were literally fighting to continue to keep human beings as slaves and continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will . I am not proud of this heritage . These practices were inhumane and were wrong , wrong , wrong .\nWhere Haley felt the need to comfort — even identify with — those who see the flag as a symbol of noble heritage , Paul Thurmond simply said , “ I am not proud. ” Simple as that . A clean break . And that , my friends , is what America needs , where white supremacy is concerned . A clean break — and then the real business of a creating a livable future for all of us can begin .",
         "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on, though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question. So now, in order to preserve the broader framework — in which, for example, that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order, and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.\n\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position, and the temporizing of others around her, I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done.

Haley continued, with a brief nod to the obvious, before hurrying on:\n\nAt the same time, for many others in South Carolina, the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past. As a state, we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints.

At least three starting points can easily be identified, however. The first came from Ta-Nehisi Coates. Honing in on the underlying claim that Roof's views did not reflect those of South Carolinians more broadly, Coates quickly weighed in to say:\n\nIf the governor meant that very few of the flag’s supporters believe in mass murder, she is surely right. But on the question of whose view of the Confederate Flag is more twisted, she is almost certainly wrong. Roof’s belief that black life had no purpose beyond subjugation is “sick and twisted” in the exact same manner as the beliefs of those who created the Confederate flag were “sick and twisted.” The Confederate flag is directly tied to the Confederate cause, and the Confederate cause was white supremacy.\n\nThis is the plain historical reality, and Coates goes on to rolls out stanza after stanza in an impressive historical litany of authoritative voices repeatedly underscoring the point, beginning with the Confederate states’ own explanations for war, starting with South Carolina, then Mississippi (which was particularly blunt: “Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world.”), Louisiana, Alabama (“the election of Mr. Lincoln cannot be regarded otherwise than … an open declaration of war”) and Texas.\n\nHe then goes on to quote notable individuals, such as Jefferson Davis, not only affirming the centrality of slavery to the Southern cause, but elaborating on their desire to extend slaveholding into Cuba, Mexico and elsewhere, as well as propounding their belief that the equality of white men was founded on the slavery of blacks, and thus would be irrevocably lost if slavery were to be abolished. Thus, white supremacy for the South was not simply an isolated belief in the inherent superiority of whites as a race, it was the foundation for an aggressive and self-styled “progressive” worldview, a whole self-contained system of thought. The flag is inextricably linked to all of that.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAs a second starting point it’s also true that the Confederate battle flag was largely a relic until it was revived in response to the Civil Rights Movement — first with Strom Thurmond’s “States Rights Party” in 1948, then with Georgia adopting a version in protest of Brown v. Board of Education in 1956, and South Carolina six years later — though, tellingly, the flag went up a year before the act authorizing it. For almost a hundred years, the South got on just fine celebrating its heritage without benefit of the flag. Indeed, the flag was raised over South Carolina as a result of the Civil War centennial celebration. This revival of interest in the flag was clearly all about renewed defiance of the federal government, which was finally being prodded into making good on the Civil War Amendments, and ensuring the full citizenship of African-Americans. Hence, today, the “heritage” the flag actually stands for is that of the 1960s, not the 1860s. Good luck with that.\n\nA third, related point, made by Jeet Heer at the New Republic, is that the flag matters tremendously as exertion of raw power. Its reintroduction in response to the Civil Rights movement sent a clear message: “The feds might try to help you, but remember who is the boss down here. We still rule.” Flying everywhere throughout the South, it sends the constant message to black Southerners, that they are not safe, they are not in control of their own personal security, much less anything else. Whatever other stories Southern whites might tell themselves and others about the flag, this basic fact remains. Indeed, the rhetorical act of denying the flag’s white supremacist meaning only demonstrates further how completely whites control things.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBeyond these three starting points, there’s a vast terrain to explore, in terms of the white supremacist legacy the flag stands for and how it has reshaped itself over time. There are at least four key elements that any such account would have to explore. First, is the matter of white supremacy itself as a matter of organized social policy — both in terms of what it supports (slavery in one era, segregation in the next, etc.) and what it opposes (abolition, integration, “big government”) — as well as the culture it both depends upon and reproduces. Second, is the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to another, both establishing purportedly new foundations, while simultaneously reinterpreting the past.\n\nIt originally expressed itself in terms of slavery, then segregation and now largely in terms of what sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva described as “colorblind racism” in his book \"Racism Without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America.\" Third, is the way in which white supremacy naturalizes, normalizes and moralizes itself, so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify, much less name, and fight against. Bonilla-Silva’s book has a great deal to say about this as well. Furthermore, the pretense that the battle flag represents Civil War-era heritage rather than Civil Rights-era hatred is a telling example of how this process unfolds. Fourth, is the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals, such bringing people together, establishing peace and harmony, promoting tolerance, etc. Haley leaned very heavily on this aspect of white supremacy in the process of pretending to reject it. So let us briefly consider each of these in turn.\n\nFirst, let’s reflect on white supremacy as a matter of organized social policy. There is nothing particularly difficult for people today to look back on past forms of white supremacy and reject them. It’s easy nowadays to see slavery or segregation as evil. Even Rand Paul, defending segregation in principle, said it was a bad business decision. But what about white supremacy policies today?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhile part of the impetus to remove the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina came from respect for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the long-serving, highly respected member of the South Carolina State Senate, this only scratched the surface of Pinckney’s politics, as pointed out by North Carolina NAACP leader the Rev. William Barber on Democracy Now! recently:\n\nReverend Pinckney, as a colleague in ministry, was not just opposed to the flag, he was opposed to the denial of Medicaid expansion, where now the majority of the state is opposing Medicaid expansion where six out of 10 black people live. He was opposed to voter suppression, voter ID in South Carolina. He was opposed to those who have celebrated the ending of the Voting Rights Act, or the gutting of Section 4, which means South Carolina is no longer a preclearance state, and the very district that he served in is vulnerable right now. He was opposed to the lack of funding for public education. He wanted to see living wages raised.\n\nEvery item Barber mentioned is felt more deeply by the black community, so it’s not hard to grasp what a true rejection of white supremacy would look like. One might say that this calls for “activist government,” but the white South was all in favor of activist government \"When Affirmative Action Was White,\" as Ira Katznelson’s 2006 book explained. Thus, Barber continued:\n\nSo I would say to my colleagues, let’s take down the flag — to the governor — but also, let’s put together an omnibus bill in the name of the nine martyrs. And all of the things Reverend Pinckney was standing for, if we say we love him and his colleagues, let’s put all of those things in a one big omnibus bill and pass that and bring it to the funeral on Friday or Saturday, saying we will expand Medicaid to help not only black people, but poor white Southerners in South Carolina, because it’s not just the flag. Lee Atwater talked about the Southern strategy, where policy was used as a way to divide us. And if we want harmony, we have to talk about racism, not just in terms of symbol, but in the substance of policies. The flag went up to fight policies. If we’re going to bring it down, we’re also going to have to change policies, and particularly policies that create disparate impact on black, brown and poor white people.\n\nThe phrase “disparate impact,” which Barber used, is key to how white supremacy operates in the post-segregation era. It’s not that the races are treated entirely differently, only that the odds, burdens, privileges and benefits change, depending on the color of your skin. Often this happens without any conscious awareness, which is why Bonilla-Silva’s phrase, “racism without racists” is so apt. This is really not difficult to grasp — unless you’ve got a vested interest in not grasping it. In which case, welcome to the world of our second topic, the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to the next, and how\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTransitions between eras are often abrupt in some respects — the swift abolition of slavery in the final years of the Civil War, for example — while taking decades to work out in other ways. In order to first establish, and then fully stabilize the segregationist era, the meaning and purpose of the Civil War itself had to be reinterpreted through a white supremacist lens. The story of how that transpired over a fifty-year period is the subject of \"Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory\" by David W. Blight. As I summarized in my review:\n\nBlight explains three broad visions of Civil War memory - reconciliationist, emancipationist and white supremacist. The first was born in wartime responses to its terrible brutality, epitomized by Walt Whitman's experience of tending the wounded and dying of both sides. The second sprang not just from the war, but also from the Emancipation Proclamation and the more than 200,000 black combatants who joined the fight. The third gradually reformulated itself after the shock of military defeat, eventually dominating reconciliationist thinking by sacrificing racial reconciliation for the sake of sectional reunion.\n\nIt was not surprising that the reconciliationist view came to dominate — politically, materially, the nation needed sectional reintegration in a much more immediate way than it needed anything for its black citizens — a calculus that would eventually change over time. What’s striking is the relative ease with which the white supremacist vision came to merge with and dominate the reconciliationist view.\n\nThis is not the exception, but the rule in American history: any moves toward reconciling differences inevitably become infected with white supremacist aims — unless, of course, they are founded on them to begin with, as the case with American Colonization Society and the movement surrounding it, more on that below. A similar process has taken place with the end of segregation and the discrediting of overt racism which the norm in that era throughout the South, as well as in much of the North. This is essence of what Bonilla-Silva reveals in \"Racism Without Racists\": a set of beliefs has emerged with superficially broad appeal, but which harbors a “hidden” white supremacist impact. Bonilla-Silva identifies four central frames at the core of colorblind racism: \"The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information,\" Bonilla-Silva writes. The first — and what I take to be the most significant and distinctive frame — is “abstract liberalism,” which he explains as follows:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe frame of abstract liberalism involves using ideas associated with political liberalism (e.g. \"equal opportunity,\" the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy) and economic liberalism (e.g., choice, individualism) in an abstract manner to explain racial matters.\n\nWhat abstract liberalism hides is virtually everything having to do with history and indeed all social science, outside the narrow framework of market economics. It hides all historical inequalities, which recent research suggests persists for as long as ten generations. It also hides subconscious racial preferences, which can create intense segregation without any overt centralized coercion. But above all, it creates the illusion of some idealized social order, which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “reverse racism.” In short, the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them: they are the “real racists,” not whites!\n\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles, but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone. These are “naturalization,” which “allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences,” “cultural racism” which “relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education’ or ‘blacks have too many babies’ to explain the standing of minorities in society” and “minimization of racism” which “suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities' life chances (‘It's better now than in the past’ or ‘There is discrimination, but there are plenty of jobs out there’).” All three of these frames have been used in past eras. For example, Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past, so segregation was something blacks could and should accept. Similarly, cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism. But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today.\n\nAs I indicated above, not only does Bonilla-Silva’s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another, it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “naturalizes, normalizes and moralizes itself, so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify, much less name, and fight against.” Indeed, this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “common sense” emerges, responding to multiple different needs at once, most typically, a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible, and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible. The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude, even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact. Meanwhile, those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order, even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics.\n\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic, the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals, such bringing people together, establishing peace and harmony, promoting tolerance and so forth. It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else, and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done. Not only does white supremacy lay down the law, if conflicts arise in response, white supremacy takes the lead in naming, identifying and analyzing them, leading to proposed white supremacist solutions. On a macro scale, this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale, from the lowliest parts on up to the whole.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society. It was originally founded to bring together two politically disparate groups, Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders, both united by the belief that free blacks faced a miserable future in America, and would be better off in Africa. This granddaddy of all “grand bargains” was laughable on its face — there hundreds of thousands of free blacks, far more than could ever be returned to Africa, even if they had all wanted to go — which most emphatically did not. But it was extremely popular with political elites, precisely because of its centrist power to “bring people together” — white people, that is. In his book, \"Of One Blood: Abolitionism and the Origins of Racial Equality,\" historian Paul Goodman had this to say:\n\nBy 1817, African colonization had become more than a speculative idea. In the next decade, hundreds of prominent Americans--political leaders including Presidents Madison and Monroe and religious leaders in most of the large denominations, from Presbyterian Lyman Beecher of Massachusetts to Episcopalian bishop William Mead of Virginia—threw their prestige and influence behind the America Colonization Society (ACS), which established the colony of Liberia in West Africa. One of the most impressive voluntary societies of its day, the ACS boasted over two hundred state and local auxiliaries by 1830. It was quietly assisted by President Monroe and endorsed by state legislatures and the major religious denominations, as well as by an illustrious panoply of notables.\n\nAs Goodman goes on to describe, the 19th-Century abolitionist movement was born out of free blacks’ opposition to the ACS. It was precisely their unwillingness to be “reasonable” which formed the foundation of resistance which eventually spread to white abolitionists, and over a period five decades, eventually resulted in emancipation. Yet, almost up until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation he himself continued to be a supporter of colonization — such was the power of this “centrist” white supremacist vision. In fact, the ACS lived on for almost 100 years after Lincoln’s death — it only shut down in 1964!\n\nThere are many other instances in which the cause of black freedom only advanced by refusing to be “reasonable” or to live up to some purported virtue or another. That’s because white supremacy, in one form or another, has always had such an enormous say in dictating what it meant to be “reasonable” or virtuous. And so it’s been incumbent on blacks to learn to think outside the box — to find a broader framework of understanding on which to found their moral as well as their political analysis.\n\nThis is why Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once spoke to the American Psychological Association, and came out proudly for the cause of what he called “creative maladjustment”:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI am sure that we will recognize that there are some things in our society, some things in our world, to which we should never be adjusted. There are some things concerning which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will. We must never adjust ourselves to racial discrimination and racial segregation. We must never adjust ourselves to religious bigotry. We must never adjust ourselves to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. We must never adjust ourselves to the madness of militarism, and the self-defeating effects of physical violence…. Thus, it may well be that our world is in dire need of a new organization, The International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment.\n\nSimilarly, King’s “Letter From Birmingham Jail” was all about rejecting the framework of passive, superficial words of peace, moderation and restraint which the white ministers of Birmingham sought to impose on him. Here is just a small section of the wisdom it contains:\n\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with.\n\nI could not help myself thinking about the profound wrong-headed of “reasonable” white supremacy as I heard Nikki Haley’s speech, which is why my enthusiasm for it was so dimmed. In perhaps her most deeply typical move, she said there didn’t have to be winners and losers. Folks who love the flag and folks who despise it can all get along just fine! But, of course, that leaves the entire substantive agenda Reverend Barber spoke about dead on arrival — just as it was supposed to do. There is no real underlying intent to address and disown the evil of white supremacy. The only way that evil is faced is by projecting it onto the disowned Confederate son, Dylann Roof.\n\nA good way to understand what’s wrong with Haley’s speech is to compare it with a speech by a quintessential white Southerner, Strom Thurmond’s son, whose speech makes no such attempt to defend the blind worship of “heritage.” Here is what South Carolina State Senator Paul Thurmond said:\n\nI am aware of my heritage. But my appreciation for the things that my forebearers accomplished to make my life better doesn’t mean that I must believe that they always made the right decisions and, for the life of me, I will never understand how anyone could fight a civil war based, in part, on the desire to continue the practice of slavery. Think about it for just a second. Our ancestors were literally fighting to continue to keep human beings as slaves and continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will. I am not proud of this heritage. These practices were inhumane and were wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\nWhere Haley felt the need to comfort — even identify with — those who see the flag as a symbol of noble heritage, Paul Thurmond simply said, “I am not proud.” Simple as that. A clean break. And that, my friends, is what America needs, where white supremacy is concerned. A clean break — and then the real business of a creating a livable future for all of us can begin.",

Netanyahu was asked directly about whether his Bar-Ilan speech was “ irrelevant. ” Here is what Netanyahu actually said :\nNETANYAHU : I think anyone who is going to build a Palestinian state today will be freeing up space to give an attack area to radical Islam against Israel .

We 're making some additional modest changes to get to balance . '' Ryan , R-Wis. , told reporters at briefing last week . `` We 're adding some other policies that finish the job , but I would n't expect big surprises from us next week .

''\nThis time , Ryan points to two unlikely factors that actually help achieve the conservative goal : revenue and sequestration .\n`` Revenue went up significantly two months ago with the `` Fiscal Cliff '' deal . The baselines changed . We 're not going to refight that fight , '' Ryan said , referring to $ 600 billion in new tax revenue President Obama secured in the deal . `` We also have some lower spending and lower deficits in that baseline as well [ as a result of sequestration ] . ''\nWhile Ryan is the chief author of the GOP 's budget proposal , he does not work alone and there are varying perspectives .

''\nBut some GOP insiders confidentially question whether Ryan can pass his budget out of a committee markup this week . Republicans hold a narrow 22-17 seat advantage over Democrats on the committee . With Democrats ideologically against his proposals , Ryan can only afford losing two Republicans before a third dissenter stalls the resolution in committee .\n`` Ryan 's budget is facing opposition from many sides , including within his own committee , '' one Republican congressional source said on the condition of anonymity . `` He loses votes on everything from Medicare and entitlement changes to his drastic discretionary cuts , and it will be difficult for him to pass his budget out of committee , let alone the House floor . ''\nWhile Ryan would not elaborate on any details from his new budget ahead of Tuesday 's release , there are reports he could raise the threshold at which people are protected from changes to the Medicare eligibility age .\nOn the House floor , Republicans hold a 232-200 majority , plus there are three vacant seats . With 216 votes constituting a simple majority , House Speaker John Boehner and Ryan can lose just 16 rank and file Republicans . Last year 10 Republicans voted against the Ryan budget on the floor , but in the new session of Congress where the GOP 's majority is slimmer than the last session , Boehner has needed Democratic votes to pass several essential pieces of legislation .\nAt a pen and pad briefing last week , Ryan did his best to assure reporters that all Republican members on the committee are `` unified .

''\nWhile some of the most conservative Republicans griped in the past that Ryan 's budgets did not cut spending quickly enough , Rep. Tom Cole , a member of both the Budget and Appropriations committees , called Ryan 's bid the `` most aggressive budget by any majority in recent years . ''\nWhile meeting the spending caps could puzzle the appropriators ' work later this year , Cole urged House Republicans to rally around Ryan 's proposal .

Congress and the White House reached a deal Tuesday that would provide another $ 310 billion .\nTo get the loans forgiven , companies need to spend 75 % on payroll within eight weeks of receiving the money . The other 25 % can be spent on rent , utilities , and mortgage payments . Otherwise , the loan has generous terms : Only a 1 % interest rate and six months before any principal is due .\nMany of the small companies that were able to obtain a loan are having second thoughts about rehiring all their workers and a few plan to return the money . Others will use what they can on rent and utilities , and will use some to rehire a portion of their laid-off staff . But most are unsure they will be able to reopen eight weeks from now . They see little point in rehiring all their workers , paying them to do little or nothing , and then potentially laying them off again if business remains weak two months from now .\n“ You ’ re turning the business into a pass through for the federal government , ” said Joe Walsh , who owns Clean Green Maine , a cleaning service in Portland , Maine with 35 employees . “ You ’ re doing very little to actually help the business . ”\nIt ’ s unclear how much the small business lending program can hold back the surge in joblessness — a record 22 million people sought unemployment aid in the past month . Most economists forecast the unemployment rate will reach between 15 % and 20 % when the monthly jobs report is released in early May .\nMore money is clearly needed : Roughly 1.6 million small companies were able to obtain loans , the Small Business Administration said , out of at least 6 million that were likely eligible , according to Census data . Bank of America economists estimate that another $ 650 billion would be necessary to meet demand .\nAlso , the generous unemployment aid that was also included in the government ’ s relief package has made it more difficult to rehire . Many workers are making more with unemployment checks , which now include a $ 600 weekly benefit from the federal government .\nWalsh , who received a $ 280,000 loan from the SBA , said that he is reluctant to push his employees to return to work because , under unemployment benefit rules , they could lose their weekly checks if they turn down potential jobs .\n“ That ’ s just putting me as the employer in a really difficult position , ” Walsh said . He pays at least $ 17 an hour , with benefits , but his former employees are getting the equivalent of roughly $ 25 an hour from unemployment .\nRight now , Walsh ’ s business is closed due to lack of demand for cleaning services . He hopes to reopen soon and bring back some workers , retrain them on new sanitizing processes , and earn a bit of revenue . Still , he doubts his business will be anywhere close to what it was anytime soon , which means his workforce won ’ t be either .\n“ There ’ s no way that I ’ m getting to 100 % employment by the end of 8 weeks , ” he said .\nThe National Federation for Independent Business , a small business advocacy group , is pushing the government to make it easier for loans to be forgiven .\nThe group wants the SBA to eliminate the requirement that 75 % be spent on payroll , or at least reduce it to 50 % . It also wants the rehiring window extended beyond eight weeks and is pushing for a “ good faith ” provision that would credit companies for trying to rehire workers who prefer unemployment aid instead .\nThe NFIB also asked that half the next round of funding be reserved for businesses with fewer than 20 employees , to counter complaints that many large , publicly-traded companies obtained loans in the first round . The agreement reached late Tuesday did not make that change but directed some funds to smaller banks .\nAccording to a survey of its members , the NFIB said that just half of those who have applied for loans expect that they will rehire all their workers and get the entire amount forgiven . A quarter expect that at least three-quarters of the loan will be forgiven , while 15 % didn ’ t know .\nThe American Sustainable Business Council and several other small business groups are pushing to have the starting date for rehiring shifted from the date a company received a loan to the date it can legally reopen .

         "I can not wait to learn more about the identity and motives of the secret whistleblower who figures so prominently in stories of Trump ’ s phone call with the newly elected Ukrainian president . The narrative that began a month ago , as an insider ’ s accusation of Trump ’ s threat to cut off U.S. military aid unless investigations were launched into his expected opponent Joe Biden , has evolved considerably .\nIt now appears — in spite of initial denials — that the whistleblower consulted with House Intelligence Committee ( HIC ) staff before filing his complaint — and was advised immediately to obtain counsel . Somehow , the chosen counsel was part of a whistleblower search organization , whose staff had previously worked with HIC chairman Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) . While the whistleblower ’ s complaint was based entirely on secondhand hearsay — which was explicitly precluded under existing reporting rules — those rules were changed after the complaint ’ s receipt so as to do away with the requirement of firsthand knowledge .\nWhat began as an admission that the whistleblower worked for the CIA and was a registered Democrat was accompanied by the absolute assurance that he was not an active partisan and had not worked in any current presidential campaign . That assurance now seems to be evolving into a situation in which the whistleblower had been assigned to the National Security Council , where he worked with former Vice President Biden — and may even have traveled with him on one or more trips to Ukraine .\nWords are being chosen quite carefully , and the truth seems more and more elusive , as Republican HIC members continue to be kept in the dark . One is reminded of Lewis Carroll ’ s Alice in Wonderland , in which Alice exclaims , “ Curiouser and curiouser ! ”\nWhile the mainstream media continues to provide breathless coverage as events unfold , they evidence a strong disinclination to ferret out more information regarding the whistleblower ’ s actual identity or motives in coming forward — almost relishing the idea that HIC hearings can feature his testimony ( whether he is actually present or not ) without his identity ever becoming known .\nThe obvious parallel is to “ Deep Throat , ” Woodward and Bernstein ’ s alleged secret source for many of their Watergate revelations , whose identity remained not only secret but also an integral part of Georgetown cocktail conversation for the next 30 years .\nFor those not living through the halcyon days of Watergate , Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein became famous for their series of revelations regarding the status of prosecutors ’ ongoing Watergate investigations , but it was not until their 1974 book , All the President ’ s Men , that they credited a secret source they claimed to have referred to as “ Deep Throat , ” after a popular pornographic movie character . The more recent backstory is that their publisher at Simon & Schuster had encouraged them to add more drama to their proposed book , which is how the term first came into being . In short , Deep Throat was not a term used in print or even newsroom discussions before it first appeared in their book — as their calculatedly mysterious source .\nRegardless , speculation about just who Deep Throat might be was a dominant feature of Washington gossip for the ensuing decades . Possible candidates were inevitably confined to those who had served on President Nixon ’ s White House staff , including his Chief of Staff Alexander Haig , one of his many lawyers ( John Dean , Fred Fielding , Len Garment , or Fred Buzhardt ) , one of his speechwriters ( Bill Safire , David Gergen , or Ben Stein ) , or one of other young White House aides ( including Diane Sawyer , Jonathan Rose , or Jeff Donfeld ) . Even Henry Kissinger ’ s name occasionally surfaced in the unending speculation .\nThe common theme was that Deep Throat had become so disgusted with Nixon ’ s conduct that the need to reveal the wrongdoing far outweighed any idea of loyalty to the president . This was in spite of the fact that my boss and Nixon ’ s lead Watergate defense counsel thought at the time that the leaks were coming from Mark Felt at the FBI . This belief was accompanied by the recognition that we weren ’ t in a position to do much about it , since pressuring Felt might result in even more leaks . In fact , there is a humorous conversation on the White House tapes in which Haig suggests to Nixon that Felt is the one doing the leaking — and characterizes him as “ the white rat. ” Haig goes on to explain that ’ s what Felt is called behind his back at the Bureau : He has a long face and a rather sallow complexion . “ Well , Mr. President , he looks like a rat , ” is how Haig finally sums it up .\nFor decades afterwards , when I would mention that I had worked on Nixon ’ s White House staff , people would inevitably ask if I knew who Deep Throat was . When I answered in the affirmative , they would get all excited — until I said it was Mark Felt , the white rat . Then , since this obviously was not some famous name from Nixon ’ s own White House , their interest would wane and the conversation would move on .\nWhen Felt ’ s daughter claimed he was Deep Throat in 2005 and Woodward and Bernstein rushed out a book , The Secret Man : The Story of Watergate ’ s Deep Throat , supposedly confirming it , everyone accepted it at face value . For his part , Felt was way too senile to provide any real confirmation . More significantly , it turned out that Felt had no animosity toward President Nixon ; his leaks were designed to show that Acting FBI Director Patrick Gray couldn ’ t control the FBI and should be replaced by then–Deputy Director Felt .\nWhy , then , had all of the media been so certain for the prior three decades that Deep Throat simply had to be a disillusioned Nixon White House staffer ?

         "I cannot wait to learn more about the identity and motives of the secret whistleblower who figures so prominently in stories of Trump’s phone call with the newly elected Ukrainian president. The narrative that began a month ago, as an insider’s accusation of Trump’s threat to cut off U.S. military aid unless investigations were launched into his expected opponent Joe Biden, has evolved considerably.\n\nIt now appears — in spite of initial denials — that the whistleblower consulted with House Intelligence Committee (HIC) staff before filing his complaint — and was advised immediately to obtain counsel. Somehow, the chosen counsel was part of a whistleblower search organization, whose staff had previously worked with HIC chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). While the whistleblower’s complaint was based entirely on secondhand hearsay — which was explicitly precluded under existing reporting rules — those rules were changed after the complaint’s receipt so as to do away with the requirement of firsthand knowledge.\n\nWhat began as an admission that the whistleblower worked for the CIA and was a registered Democrat was accompanied by the absolute assurance that he was not an active partisan and had not worked in any current presidential campaign. That assurance now seems to be evolving into a situation in which the whistleblower had been assigned to the National Security Council, where he worked with former Vice President Biden — and may even have traveled with him on one or more trips to Ukraine.\n\nWords are being chosen quite carefully, and the truth seems more and more elusive, as Republican HIC members continue to be kept in the dark. One is reminded of Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, in which Alice exclaims, “Curiouser and curiouser!”\n\nWhile the mainstream media continues to provide breathless coverage as events unfold, they evidence a strong disinclination to ferret out more information regarding the whistleblower’s actual identity or motives in coming forward — almost relishing the idea that HIC hearings can feature his testimony (whether he is actually present or not) without his identity ever becoming known.\n\nThe obvious parallel is to “Deep Throat,” Woodward and Bernstein’s alleged secret source for many of their Watergate revelations, whose identity remained not only secret but also an integral part of Georgetown cocktail conversation for the next 30 years.\n\nFor those not living through the halcyon days of Watergate, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein became famous for their series of revelations regarding the status of prosecutors’ ongoing Watergate investigations, but it was not until their 1974 book, All the President’s Men, that they credited a secret source they claimed to have referred to as “Deep Throat,” after a popular pornographic movie character. The more recent backstory is that their publisher at Simon & Schuster had encouraged them to add more drama to their proposed book, which is how the term first came into being. In short, Deep Throat was not a term used in print or even newsroom discussions before it first appeared in their book — as their calculatedly mysterious source.\n\nRegardless, speculation about just who Deep Throat might be was a dominant feature of Washington gossip for the ensuing decades. Possible candidates were inevitably confined to those who had served on President Nixon’s White House staff, including his Chief of Staff Alexander Haig, one of his many lawyers (John Dean, Fred Fielding, Len Garment, or Fred Buzhardt), one of his speechwriters (Bill Safire, David Gergen, or Ben Stein), or one of other young White House aides (including Diane Sawyer, Jonathan Rose, or Jeff Donfeld). Even Henry Kissinger’s name occasionally surfaced in the unending speculation.\n\nThe common theme was that Deep Throat had become so disgusted with Nixon’s conduct that the need to reveal the wrongdoing far outweighed any idea of loyalty to the president. This was in spite of the fact that my boss and Nixon’s lead Watergate defense counsel thought at the time that the leaks were coming from Mark Felt at the FBI. This belief was accompanied by the recognition that we weren’t in a position to do much about it, since pressuring Felt might result in even more leaks. In fact, there is a humorous conversation on the White House tapes in which Haig suggests to Nixon that Felt is the one doing the leaking — and characterizes him as “the white rat.” Haig goes on to explain that’s what Felt is called behind his back at the Bureau: He has a long face and a rather sallow complexion. “Well, Mr. President, he looks like a rat,” is how Haig finally sums it up.\n\nFor decades afterwards, when I would mention that I had worked on Nixon’s White House staff, people would inevitably ask if I knew who Deep Throat was. When I answered in the affirmative, they would get all excited — until I said it was Mark Felt, the white rat. Then, since this obviously was not some famous name from Nixon’s own White House, their interest would wane and the conversation would move on.\n\nWhen Felt’s daughter claimed he was Deep Throat in 2005 and Woodward and Bernstein rushed out a book, The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate’s Deep Throat, supposedly confirming it, everyone accepted it at face value. For his part, Felt was way too senile to provide any real confirmation. More significantly, it turned out that Felt had no animosity toward President Nixon; his leaks were designed to show that Acting FBI Director Patrick Gray couldn’t control the FBI and should be replaced by then–Deputy Director Felt.\n\nWhy, then, had all of the media been so certain for the prior three decades that Deep Throat simply had to be a disillusioned Nixon White House staffer? Following Felt’s 2005 outing, I went back and re-read All the President’s Men and then compared the book to the subsequent movie version — only to discover tantalizing differences in Deep Throat’s treatment.\n\nIn their book, there is no implication whatsoever that Deep Throat is a White House employee. The authors were very careful not to give any hint at all as to his place of employment. The movie version, however, differs considerably — with implied White House employment occurring in three separate scenes: First, relatively early on, Woodward (played by Robert Redford) and Bernstein (played by Dustin Hoffman) are shown on the Library of Congress steps, lamenting that they are out of leads.

I don’t know how many meetings in the garage.… There’s a residual fear in my soul that that isn’t quite straight.\n\nIt also is interesting to note that lead Watergate prosecutor Earl Silbert has stated that nothing in the Woodward and Bernstein articles was helpful to his team of prosecutors since their stories were only reporting what the government already knew and had under investigation.

         "WASHINGTON – For the first time in his presidency , Donald Trump gave his State of the Union address to a divided Congress . The president did n't flinch as he faced a House of Representatives led by Democrats who have recently pushed for late-term abortions .\nTrump boldly pushed back on that agenda , saying America 's leaders need to `` work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life . '' The president then called on Congress to pass legislation to prohibit late-term abortions .\n`` Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother 's womb moments before birth , '' Trump said . `` These are living , feeling , beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world . ''\n`` And then , we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth , '' the president continued . `` All children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of God .

         "WASHINGTON – For the first time in his presidency, Donald Trump gave his State of the Union address to a divided Congress. The president didn't flinch as he faced a House of Representatives led by Democrats who have recently pushed for late-term abortions.\n\nTrump boldly pushed back on that agenda, saying America's leaders need to \"work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.\" The president then called on Congress to pass legislation to prohibit late-term abortions.\n\n\n\n\"Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth,\" Trump said. \"These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world.\"\n\n\"And then, we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth,\" the president continued. \"All children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of God.\"\n\nThe Case for a Border Wall\n\n\n\nThe commander in chief also broke down his vision for safe and legal immigration, demanding a wall be constructed along America's southern border.\n\nHe illustrated his point by hosting the family members of Gerald and Sharon David, an elderly couple murdered in their Nevada home just last month by an immigrant who was in the US illegally.\n\n\"I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again,\" Trump said. \"Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.\"\n\n\"Simply put – walls save lives,\" he stated. \"In the past, most people in this room voted for a wall – but the proper wall never got built.

         "By cutting funds for Head Start , sequestration has sent low-income children in some states home 10 days early . But the federal government 's inability to agree on a budget did n't prevent 2,800 Head Start leaders from attending a three-day conference in National Harbor , Md. , this week .\nChalk it up to the peculiarities of the sequester . In this case , it 's O.K . to cut classes for kids , but not O.K . to reallocate Training and Technical Assistance funds .\nNational Harbor is along the Potomac River , just over the border from Washington , D.C. ; it offers hotels , restaurants , shopping and a marina . The Office of Head Start held its second annual `` National Birth to Five Leadership Institute '' conference at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center . Rooms went for $ 224 per room per night , a rate set by the U.S General Services Administration ; according to Kenneth Wolfe , deputy director of Administration for Children & Families ' office of public affairs , the event 's total approved cost was $ 752,059 , not including the cost of the stay , meals and air-fare for the grantees .\nThe conference included seminars and lectures focused on teaching parents , educators and administrators to use data to improve programs . Head Start 's mission is to help low-income children from birth to age five develop socially and cognitively before they enter the formal education system .\nCommunity Action Partnership of Kern ( CAPK ) in Bakersfield , Calif. , sent four team members to the training .\nCAPK had to reduce the number of days they offer their program this year from 168 to 158 , two days below the national standard minimum . Next year they plan to operate 160 days .\nMark Corum , outreach and resource development manager for CAPK , said any day their children are n't attending Head Start is a detriment to both the children 's learning and the parents .\n`` Ideally we 're trying to help people with a safety net . You know , they 've fallen through the cracks , '' Corum told ███ on Thursday . `` It 's the total family that we bring and embrace and try to make them better . ''\nHe 's seen `` firsthand '' how the program has helped parents and children with achieve success in life .\nTo celebrate Head Start and protest the cuts , Massachusetts organizers are planning a parade on Boston Common for May 31 .\nThey `` [ h ] ope to … perhaps convince some folks in Washington that our children are as important as air traffic controllers and meat inspectors and that they should seriously consider rescinding this foolish sequester that is causing havoc with the lives of our most underprivileged families , '' John Drew , president and CEO of Action for Boston Community Development ( ABCD ) , told ███ in an email Thursday .\nREAD MORE : Pre-School for All : President Obama 's Pipe Dream or Possibility ?\nThe Boston-area Head Start programs considered cutting as many as 250 slots for children at the onset of the sequester cuts . They are continuing to figure out `` how many classes , children , teachers and parents will be left behind , '' when cuts go into effect for their programs in September , Drew said . Of their 650-person staff , ABCD sent two to the conference .\nSo how can programs facing a 5.2 percent decrease in their budgets afford to send staff to the national conference ?\nGroups are drawing from a section of their budget set aside for `` Training and Technical Assistance . '' Congress allocates funds for this separately from Head Start 's operating costs , and the Office of Head Start absorbed all of the TTA sequester cuts , so that grantee 's TTA budgets would remain intact .\n`` The Office of Head Start is committed to working with programs to ensure the provision of high-quality services continue during this challenging time of sequestration , '' Kenneth Wolfe , deputy director of Administration for Children & Families ' office of public affairs , told ███ in an email .\nTTA money can not be reallocated to cover operating costs without direction from Congress .\nSo while Vanessa Gibbons , director of Jackson County Civic Action Committee in Moss Point , Miss. , would rather use the money to continue giving her young students a safe place to go before their older siblings ' schools let out for the summer , she instead has had to cut her program 10 days short this year .\n`` They specifically told us we could not cut our training budget . Those dollars were not even in the equation . That would have made it easy . But that was not even an option , '' Gibbons told ███ .\nThe problem is similar to the one the Federal Aviation Administration faced , which led them to furlough workers and space out flights in a way that slowed air travel . But Congress quickly passed a measure giving the FAA the flexibility to reallocate unused improvement funds in order to quash the irksome flight delays .\nREAD MORE : Food Safety , Unemployment , Flood Predictors Still Subject to Sequestration\nSome on the left have criticized Congress for a bill targeted at helping the FAA .\n`` Members of Congress fly often , so they 're fixing that sequester mess , '' New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote on Twitter . `` But no fix for kids sequestered out of Head Start . ''\nRep. Rosa DeLauro , D-Conn. , posted an animation of an airplane on Twitter with the hashtag , `` # endthesequester . ''\n`` 4 million meals for seniors eliminated … 70,000 children kicked out of Head Start … 125,000 Americans without rental assistance , '' the message in white lettering on the black plane read . `` But your next flight will be on time .

Next year they plan to operate 160 days.\n\nREAD MORE: 57 Terrible Consequences of the Sequester\n\nMark Corum, outreach and resource development manager for CAPK, said any day their children aren't attending Head Start is a detriment to both the children's learning and the parents.\n\n\"Ideally we're trying to help people with a safety net. You know, they've fallen through the cracks,\" Corum told ABC News on Thursday. \"It's the total family that we bring and embrace and try to make them better.\"\n\nHe's seen \"firsthand\" how the program has helped parents and children with achieve success in life.\n\nTo celebrate Head Start and protest the cuts, Massachusetts organizers are planning a parade on Boston Common for May 31.\n\nThey \"[h]ope to … perhaps convince some folks in Washington that our children are as important as air traffic controllers and meat inspectors and that they should seriously consider rescinding this foolish sequester that is causing havoc with the lives of our most underprivileged families,\" John Drew, president and CEO of Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD), told ABC News in an email Thursday.\n\nREAD MORE: Pre-School for All: President Obama's Pipe Dream or Possibility?\n\nThe Boston-area Head Start programs considered cutting as many as 250 slots for children at the onset of the sequester cuts. They are continuing to figure out \"how many classes, children, teachers and parents will be left behind,\" when cuts go into effect for their programs in September, Drew said. Of their 650-person staff, ABCD sent two to the conference.\n\nSo how can programs facing a 5.2 percent decrease in their budgets afford to send staff to the national conference?\n\nGroups are drawing from a section of their budget set aside for \"Training and Technical Assistance.\" Congress allocates funds for this separately from Head Start's operating costs, and the Office of Head Start absorbed all of the TTA sequester cuts, so that grantee's TTA budgets would remain intact.\n\n\"The Office of Head Start is committed to working with programs to ensure the provision of high-quality services continue during this challenging time of sequestration,\" Kenneth Wolfe, deputy director of Administration for Children & Families' office of public affairs, told ABC News in an email.\n\nTTA money cannot be reallocated to cover operating costs without direction from Congress.\n\nSo while Vanessa Gibbons, director of Jackson County Civic Action Committee in Moss Point, Miss., would rather use the money to continue giving her young students a safe place to go before their older siblings' schools let out for the summer, she instead has had to cut her program 10 days short this year.\n\n\"They specifically told us we could not cut our training budget. Those dollars were not even in the equation. That would have made it easy. But that was not even an option,\" Gibbons told ABC News.\n\nThe problem is similar to the one the Federal Aviation Administration faced, which led them to furlough workers and space out flights in a way that slowed air travel. But Congress quickly passed a measure giving the FAA the flexibility to reallocate unused improvement funds in order to quash the irksome flight delays.\n\nREAD MORE: Food Safety, Unemployment, Flood Predictors Still Subject to Sequestration\n\nSome on the left have criticized Congress for a bill targeted at helping the FAA.\n\n\"Members of Congress fly often, so they're fixing that sequester mess,\" New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote on Twitter. \"But no fix for kids sequestered out of Head Start.\"\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., posted an animation of an airplane on Twitter with the hashtag, \"#endthesequester.\"\n\n\"4 million meals for seniors eliminated … 70,000 children kicked out of Head Start … 125,000 Americans without rental assistance,\" the message in white lettering on the black plane read. \"But your next flight will be on time.\"",

         "As a first step , I believe it necessary for the members and leadership of the Democratic National Committee to step down and be replaced by people who are determined to create a party that represents America – including all those who feel powerless and disenfranchised , and who have been left out of our politics and left behind in our economy .\nThe Democratic Party as it is now constituted has become a giant fundraising machine , too often reflecting the goals and values of the moneyed interests . This must change . The election of 2016 has repudiated it . We need a people ’ s party – a party capable of organizing and mobilizing Americans in opposition to Donald Trump ’ s Republican party , which is about to take over all three branches of the U.S. government . We need a New Democratic Party that will fight against intolerance and widening inequality .\nWhat happened in America Tuesday should not be seen as a victory for hatefulness over decency . It is more accurately understood as a repudiation of the American power structure .\nAt the core of that structure are the political leaders of both parties , their political operatives , and fundraisers ; the major media , centered in New York and Washington DC ; the country ’ s biggest corporations , their top executives , and Washington lobbyists and trade associations ; the biggest Wall Street banks , their top officers , traders , hedge-fund and private-equity managers , and their lackeys in Washington ; and the wealthy individuals who invest directly in politics .\nAt the start of the 2016 election cycle , this power structure proclaimed Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush shoo-ins for the nominations of the Democratic and Republican parties . After all , both of these individuals had deep bases of funders , well-established networks of political insiders , experienced political advisers and all the political name recognition any candidate could possibly want .\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the White House . The presidency was won by Donald Trump , who made his fortune marketing office towers and casinos , and , more recently , starring in a popular reality-television program , and who has never held elective office or had anything to do with the Republican party . Hillary Clinton narrowly won the popular vote , but not enough of the states and their electors secure a victory .\nHillary Clinton ’ s defeat is all the more remarkable in that her campaign vastly outspent the Trump campaign on television and radio advertisements , and get-out-the-vote efforts . Moreover , her campaign had the support in the general election not of only the kingpins of the Democratic party but also many leading Republicans , including most of the politically active denizens of Wall Street and the top executives of America ’ s largest corporations , and even former Republican president George HW Bush . Her campaign team was run by seasoned professionals who knew the ropes . She had the visible and forceful backing of Barack Obama , whose popularity has soared in recent months , and his popular wife . And , of course , she had her husband .\nTrump , by contrast , was shunned by the power structure . Mitt Romney , the Republican presidential candidate in 2012 , actively worked against Trump ’ s nomination . Many senior Republicans refused to endorse him , or even give him their support . The Republican National Committee did not raise money for Trump to the extent it had for other Republican candidates for president .\nThere had been hints of the political earthquake to come . Trump had won the Republican primaries , after all . More tellingly , Clinton had been challenged in the Democratic primaries by the unlikeliest of candidates – a 74-year-old Jewish senator from Vermont who described himself as a democratic socialist and who was not even a Democrat . Bernie Sanders went on to win 22 states and 47 percent of the vote in those primaries . Sanders ’ major theme was that the country ’ s political and economic system was rigged in favor of big corporations , Wall Street and the very wealthy .\nThe power structure of America wrote off Sanders as an aberration , and , until recently , didn ’ t take Trump seriously . A respected political insider recently told me most Americans were largely content with the status quo . “ The economy is in good shape , ” he said . “ Most Americans are better off than they ’ ve been in years . ”\nRecent economic indicators may be up , but those indicators don ’ t reflect the insecurity most Americans continue to feel , nor the seeming arbitrariness and unfairness they experience . Nor do the major indicators show the linkages many Americans see between wealth and power , stagnant or declining real wages , soaring CEO pay , and the undermining of democracy by big money .\nMedian family income is lower now than it was 16 years ago , adjusted for inflation . Workers without college degrees – the old working class – have fallen furthest . Most economic gains , meanwhile , have gone to top . These gains have translated into political power to elicit bank bailouts , corporate subsidies , special tax loopholes , favorable trade deals and increasing market power without interference by anti-monopoly enforcement – all of which have further reduced wages and pulled up profits .\nWealth , power and crony capitalism fit together . Americans know a takeover has occurred , and they blame the establishment for it .\nThe Democratic party once represented the working class . But over the last three decades the party has been taken over by Washington-based fundraisers , bundlers , analysts , and pollsters who have focused instead on raising campaign money from corporate and Wall Street executives and getting votes from upper middle-class households in “ swing ” suburbs .\nDemocrats have occupied the White House for 16 of the last 24 years , and for four of those years had control of both houses of Congress . But in that time they failed to reverse the decline in working-class wages and economic security . Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ardently pushed for free trade agreements without providing millions of blue-collar workers who thereby lost their jobs means of getting new ones that paid at least as well .\nThey stood by as corporations hammered trade unions , the backbone of the white working class – failing to reform labor laws to impose meaningful penalties on companies that violate them , or help workers form unions with simple up-or-down votes . Partly as a result , union membership sank from 22 percent of all workers when Bill Clinton was elected president to less than 12 percenttoday , and the working class lost bargaining leverage to get a share of the economy ’ s gains .\nBill Clinton and Obama also allowed antitrust enforcement to ossify – with the result that large corporations have grown far larger , and major industries more concentrated . The unsurprising result of this combination – more trade , declining unionization and more industry concentration – has been to shift political and economic power to big corporations and the wealthy , and to shaft the working class . This created an opening for Donald Trump ’ s authoritarian demagoguery , and his presidency .\nNow Americans have rebelled by supporting someone who wants to fortify America against foreigners as well as foreign-made goods . The power structure understandably fears that Trump ’ s isolationism will stymie economic growth . But most Americans couldn ’ t care less about growth because for years they have received few of its benefits , while suffering most of its burdens in the forms of lost jobs and lower wages .\nThe power structure is shocked by the outcome of the 2016 election because it has cut itself off from the lives of most Americans .

         "Note From Senior Management : This piece was erroneously framed by our author as a “ fact check , ” when , instead , it was and should have been framed as an opinion piece . The opinion that the author was trying to convey was his belief that nobody in their right mind would think that Trump was literally suggesting that people should inject disinfectant into their bodies – which is how many in the media were portraying the President ’ s comments at yesterday ’ s press conference . The piece has been re-framed as it should have been originally ( as opinion ) , and further updated to reflect President Trump ’ s statement this morning that he was being sarcastic . We apologize for the error , and you are welcome for all the opportunities to dunk on us on Twitter .\nAfter yesterday ’ s Coronavirus Task Force press briefing , the media quickly seized on a discussion over potential treatments for the coronavirus COVID-19 where the president asked about the potential for a disinfectant injection .\n“ And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute . One minute . And is there a way we can do something like that , by injection inside or almost a cleaning ? ” The President said . “ So it ’ d be interesting to check that . ”\nThe President told a group of reporters Friday that he was being sarcastic .\nIn Thursday ’ s White House coronavirus task force briefing , Bill Bryan , leader of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security , described the results of new government research that showed that the coronavirus did not survive long in solar light , warmer temperatures , and more humid conditions . He added that disinfectants had also been effective against it .\nTrump , responding to that , noted that there had been discussions of testing ultraviolet light on patients , or of methods to bring light inside the body . “ And then I see the disinfectant , where it knocks it [ the virus ] out in a minute . One minute . And is there a way we can do something like that , by injection inside , or almost a cleaning , cause you see it gets in the lungs . ”\nTrump was far from a model of clarity , but he did not actually propose injecting patients with disinfectant ; he deferred to “ medical doctors ” to figure out how to apply Bryan ’ s research .\nWhen ABC News ’ Jonathan Karl asked Bryan about whether the president had proposed injecting a person with “ bleach and isopropyl alcohol ” later , Trump clarified that “ It wouldn ’ t be through injection , ” and that he was talking about “ cleaning , sterilization of an area , ” and about applying the disinfectant to “ a stationary object . ”\nApparently there is no accusation too crazy for Trump ’ s critics to believe .\nJoel B.

         "Note From Senior Management: This piece was erroneously framed by our author as a “fact check,” when, instead, it was and should have been framed as an opinion piece. The opinion that the author was trying to convey was his belief that nobody in their right mind would think that Trump was literally suggesting that people should inject disinfectant into their bodies – which is how many in the media were portraying the President’s comments at yesterday’s press conference. The piece has been re-framed as it should have been originally (as opinion), and further updated to reflect President Trump’s statement this morning that he was being sarcastic. We apologize for the error, and you are welcome for all the opportunities to dunk on us on Twitter.\n\nAfter yesterday’s Coronavirus Task Force press briefing, the media quickly seized on a discussion over potential treatments for the coronavirus COVID-19 where the president asked about the potential for a disinfectant injection.\n\n“And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?” The President said. “So it’d be interesting to check that.”\n\nThe President told a group of reporters Friday that he was being sarcastic.\n\nIn Thursday’s White House coronavirus task force briefing, Bill Bryan, leader of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, described the results of new government research that showed that the coronavirus did not survive long in solar light, warmer temperatures, and more humid conditions. He added that disinfectants had also been effective against it.\n\nTrump, responding to that, noted that there had been discussions of testing ultraviolet light on patients, or of methods to bring light inside the body. “And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it [the virus] out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside, or almost a cleaning, cause you see it gets in the lungs.”\n\nTrump was far from a model of clarity, but he did not actually propose injecting patients with disinfectant; he deferred to “medical doctors” to figure out how to apply Bryan’s research.\n\nWhen ABC News’ Jonathan Karl asked Bryan about whether the president had proposed injecting a person with “bleach and isopropyl alcohol” later, Trump clarified that “It wouldn’t be through injection,” and that he was talking about “cleaning, sterilization of an area,” and about applying the disinfectant to “a stationary object.”\n\nWhite House\n\nApparently there is no accusation too crazy for Trump’s critics to believe.\n\nJoel B.

         "After 10 years of silence - a decade of dodging questions about the infamous stain on her blue dress and the jokes about the president's cigar - Bill Clinton's mistress, Monica Lewinsky, spoke out in Vanity Fair.\n\nRemembering the Monica Lewinsky Scandal\n\nHere's what she had to say:\n\n1. She May Not Stay Quiet if Hillary Runs\n\nLewinsky says she \"remained virtually reclusive\" during Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign despite repeated interview requests. Now that Hillary is reportedly mulling a 2016 bid, Lewinsky finds herself \"gun-shy yet again, fearful of 'becoming an issue' should she decide to ramp up her campaign.\" But she's not sure she'll stay quiet this time.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who says she's still recognized everywhere she goes, has had enough of \"tiptoeing around my past - and other people's futures.\"\n\nSo though she acknowledges speaking out may have severe ramifications, \"I've decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past … It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress.\"\n\n2. What She Finds 'Troubling' About Hillary\n\nLewinsky seems to resent Hillary Clinton's reaction - and rejects the then-first lady's characterization of her as a \" narcissistic loony toon.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Clinton, I read, had supposedly confided to [Diane] Blair that, in part, she blamed herself for her husband's affair (by being emotionally neglectful) and seemed to forgive him … I find her impulse to blame the Woman - not only me, but herself - troubling,\" Lewinsky argues.\n\nHer refusal to cooperate with interrogators may have been \"courageous or foolish,\" she admits. \"But narcissistic and loony?\" No way.\n\n3. The Relationship Was Consensual\n\nLewinsky maintains that her relationship with Clinton was voluntary.\n\n\"Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship,\" Lewinsky writes. \"Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position.\"\n\nNevertheless, she says, she \"regrets\" the relationship. \"Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened.,\" she writes.\n\n4. The Clintons Didn't Pay Her Off\n\nThe Clintons didn't bribe her to stay quiet, Lewinsky insists.\n\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" she writes. She turned down $10 million-plus \"offers\" (presumably interview requests) \"because they didn't feel like the right thing to do.\"\n\nHowever, money has been an issue since the incident. Lewinsky pursued a career in marketing, but \"because of what potential employers so tactfully referred to as my 'history, I was never 'quite right' for the position.\"\n\nShe has \"managed to get by (barely, at times) with my own projects… or loans from friends,\" she says.\n\n5. She Contemplated Suicide\n\nThough she never actually attempted suicide, Lewinsky says she was tempted end her own life as \"the shame, the scorn, and the fear\" washed over her.\n\nShe says the tragic suicide of 18-year-old Tyler Clementi, the gay Rutgers student who was filmed kissing another man, brought back those terrible memories and inspired her to come forward.\n\n\"Perhaps by sharing my story … I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation,\" Lewinksi says.",

         "The United Kingdom Supreme Court has ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was acting unlawfully when he suspended Parliament in August for five weeks , a move which anti-Brexit campaigners claimed was intended to thwart their attempts to prevent Britain leaving the European Union .\nIn a shock ruling which strongly went against the government on every count , the Supreme Court in London unanimously found Tuesday morning that Boris Johnson ’ s decision to suspend Parliament was not only unlawful but was null and void , meaning it legally did not take place . Parliament is now free to sit again as soon as desired by the speakers of both houses , the court explained .\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has now reacted , speaking to the BBC on a balcony of the United Nations building in New York , insisting that despite the court ruling against him this morning Brexit would still be going ahead at the end of October as planned .\nIn remarks that have already angered remainers , the Prime Minister said he regretted the decision of the court but pointed out the coalition of anti-Brexit campaigners who have worked tirelessly to prevent Britain ’ s withdrawal from going ahead .\nAs I say , I strongly disagree with this decision of the supreme court , I have the utmost respect for our judiciary , I don ’ think this was the right decision I think that the prerogative of prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge . It is perfectly usual to have Queen ’ s speech , that ’ s what we want to do . More importantly , let ’ s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit . There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU . We have a parliament that is unable to be prorogued , doesn ’ t want to have an election , and I think it is time we took things forward . …as the law currently stands , the UK leaves the EU on October the 31st come what may , but the interesting , exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal and that ’ s what we are working on .

Normal Parliamentary sessions have lasted between one and two years, being regularly suspended to clear out old unfinished legislation and to allow new government programmes to be launched.\n\nBut amid the endless Parliamentary discussion over whether to honour the result of the 2016 referendum which saw the British people vote by a margin of over one million votes — the largest democratic mandate given in British history — this Parliamentary session has rumbled on, becoming the longest since the infamous ‘long Parliament’ of the English Civil War.\n\nThe government under Mr Johnson insisted given those circumstances, and the fact the UK government has not yet been able to introduce new domestic legislation, it was reasonable to suspend Parliament.\n\nAnti-Brexit activists claim the Prime Minister not only lied to the country, but lied to the Queen, as under the British constitutional system she has to be asked as a formality to suspend Parliament.\n\nThe Associated Press has created this handy timeline of the most recent events leading up to today, to give some context for today’s ruling:\n\nJuly 24, 2019: Boris Johnson becomes prime minister after winning a party leadership contest to succeed Theresa May. He vows to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.\n\nAugust 28: Johnson suspends Parliament for a five-week period ending Oct. 14. Queen Elizabeth II approves his request, as she is required to do under Britain’s constitutional monarchy. He says it is a routine decision to set the stage for announcement of his new domestic agenda, but House of Commons Speaker John Bercow calls it a “constitutional outrage.”\n\nAugust 29: Activist Gina Miller launches legal action against Johnson at the High Court in London. Her case is subsequently joined by former prime minister John Major and others.\n\nAugust 30: In a separate case, a judge in Scotland refuses to grant an emergency measure blocking the suspension of Parliament but schedules a full hearing at a later date.\n\nSeptember 4: The Court of Session in Scotland rejects the bid to have the suspension declared unlawful.\n\nSeptember 5: The High Court in London hears Miller’s case against the suspension. Her lawyers argue the move was an “unlawful abuse of power” by the prime minister.\n\nSeptember 6: The High Court in London rejects Miller’s case. She vows to take it to the Supreme Court.\n\nSeptember 11: The Inner House of the Court of Session in Scotland rules that the suspension was illegal and was intended to “stymie” Parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline.\n\nSeptember 17: A three-day hearing on both cases begins at the Supreme Court, with 11 justices presiding.\n\nSeptember 24: The Supreme Court is scheduled to announce its decision.",

         "The horrific story of the unarmed Walter Scott 's death at the hands of Officer Michael Slager continues to reverberate . Aside from the incontrovertible evidence on the tape that the accused officer shot him in the back as if he were doing target practice , there has since emerged more tape of the traffic stop itself and audio of the officer speaking with his superiors on the phone raising even more questions about his state of mind at the time of the shooting . But as journalists have gone back and studied the officer 's record and found that he was previously investigated for taser abuse . And on even further investigation it was found that this jurisdiction is known as `` Taser town '' :\nUntil the eight shots heard ’ round the world , cops in North Charleston , South Carolina , were primarily distinguished by their zesty use of Tasers . As computed by a local newspaper in 2006 , cops there used Tasers 201 times in an 18-month period , averaging once every 40 hours in one six-month stretch and disproportionately upon African Americans . The Charleston Post & Courier did the tally after the death of a mentally ill man named Kip Black , who was tasered six times on one occasion and nine times on another . Black died immediately after the second jolting , though the coroner set the cause of death as cocaine-fueled “ excited delirium syndrome . ”\nIt 's important to note that Taser International has spent large sums convincing local coroners that this syndrome ( which primarily seems to kill people in police custody ) makes it the victim 's responsibility if they have the bad luck to die from being shot full of electricity with a taser . It 's not just illegal drugs in the system which can allegedly cause it . Adrenaline can as well . So if a person fails to remain calm in face of an arrest and finds the feeling of 50,000 volts going through their system to be stressful they have no one to blame but themselves if they die .\nThose who have been following the story of Walter Scott understand the significance of the taser . It 's not just that the officer evidently lied about Scott taking his taser , thus somehow justifying his using lethal force , or the fact that he appears to have tried to plant the taser next to the slain man 's body to cover his tracks . The man who filmed the shooting said this :\n“ I remember the police had control of the situation . He had control of Scott , and Scott was trying just to get away from the Taser . You can hear the sound of the Taser ... before I started recording . I believe he just wanted to get away from the Taser . ”\nIt 's not unusual for people to try to escape from a taser if they can . It is , quite literally , a torture device designed to force compliance with terrible pain . The people of Taser Town , particularly African American men , undoubtedly understand exactly what is going to happen if they find themselves in the custody of a police officer . Here 's one example of how it would likely go down , as reported by The Guardian :\nSlager is among three patrolmen named in a lawsuit filed by Julius Wilson , who said he was arrested after being stopped in his car in August last year . Wilson is also suing the city of North Charleston , the city police department and police chief Eddie Driggers . Speaking at a press conference on Monday , Wilson described Slager and his colleagues as “ bad , corrupt cops ” . He said : “ The use of excessive force or punishment to torture suspects is not something that should be tolerated by the North Charleston police department. ” [ ... ]\nWilson , who has a criminal record , said he was stopped on 25 August because his vehicle had a broken tail light . Scott , 50 , was stopped for the same reason on 5 April before fleeing and being shot dead by Slager . Wilson was stopped by an Officer Edwards , he said , who was joined 10 minutes later by Slager and an officer Clemens despite Wilson calmly “ making small talk and laughing ” . After refusing to step out until he was told why he was being arrested , Wilson claimed , he was forcibly pulled out of his vehicle by Slager and the two other officers . The three then “ forcibly restrained Wilson on his stomach on the pavement face down , ” the lawsuit stated . Despite Wilson “ not moving , nor resisting ” and lying with his hands above his head , the lawsuit claimed , Slager broke a silence among the officers by shouting : “ Watch out ! I ’ m going to tase ! ” He then allegedly “ shot his NCPD-issued taser into Wilson ’ s back ” . The lawsuit alleged Wilson “ writhed in pain from the electric shock ” . It said when Slager warned his colleagues he was about to fire his taser , “ Wilson was cooperating fully ” and allowing the two other officers to place his hands behind his back .\nTasers guidelines vary by department and jurisdiction , but generally their use is only considered reasonable when the subject poses a safety threat . Clearly , shooting an unarmed 50-year-old man when he runs from the taser is not one of those cases . The video of the Scott incident shows that Officer Slager is confused on that issue , to say the least . And it 's just as clear , based on that same standard , that nobody could ever claim such force is justified when presented with an unarmed suspect facing down on the ground , with his hands behind his back . Using a taser in that situation is simply a form of unofficial street justice , a little torture at the hands of the authorities to make a point . Tasers are not simply used in place of lethal force , and they 're not always used to force compliance . They are very often used as on-the-spot punishment by police who want to teach citizens a lesson .\nTake the now notorious California incident that happened to be filmed by a local news station , in which a man on horseback led police on a chase through the desert . When he fell from the horse , police swarmed and he very clearly laid down on his stomach and put his hands behind his back . Then the police beat the hell out of him and tasered him repeatedly . This footage has garnered widespread criticism because of the beating , and for good reason . It 's brutal , primitive behavior .\nBut you wo n't find many people expressing outrage about the electric shocks being administered to this man over and over again . Here 's a typical news report of the incident :\nIn video captured by cameras aboard a helicopter for KNBC , deputies gather around the man after he falls from a horse he was riding to flee from them . The video shows deputies using a stun gun on him and then repeatedly kicking and hitting him . KNBC reported that the man -- identified by authorities as Francis Pusok -- appeared to be kicked 17 times , punched 37 times and hit with a baton four times .\nAgain , if you look at the footage , Pusok was on the ground , face down with his hands behind his back before anyone tasered him or physically assaulted him . And yet the tasering is apparently considered a-ok. At the very least , it is n't mentioned as something that shocks the conscience the way the beating does.Perhaps this is because the searing pain of electro-shock does n't leave much in the way of a mark . But hideously painful it is . Yet for some reason , delivering this particular agony to a suspect is not something people reject when there is no danger to police or bystanders , and the suspect is compliant . But police do it routinely , and are rarely sanctioned for it .\nSome of this undoubtedly stems from the fact that popular culture has turned tasering into slapstick comedy . Movies and TV shows and countless Youtube videos portray it as a hilarious joke . `` Do n't tase me bro '' became as national catch phrase . But it 's not funny . Tasers can kill people . And regardless of what level of respect and compliance one thinks police are entitled to get from the public , they are not entitled to torture and punish citizens to teach them a lesson .\nWalter Scott ran from the pain of the taser and he was shot in the back numerous times for doing it . Francis Pusok was compliant and was tasered and beaten repeatedly anyway . It appears that such shootings and beatings , when captured on film anyway , are still considered beyond the pale in America these days . In both cases , officers will have to face some sanction for their behavior . Slager is facing a murder charge . It 's unknown what the California cops will face , but the FBI is investigating , so there may be some federal civil rights charges . It will be very interesting if any of the officers are charged with assault for using the taser . Let 's just say it will be among the vast minority of cases ever brought if they are .",

And it's just as clear, based on that same standard, that nobody could ever claim such force is justified when presented with an unarmed suspect facing down on the ground, with his hands behind his back. Using a taser in that situation is simply a form of unofficial street justice, a little torture at the hands of the authorities to make a point. Tasers are not simply used in place of lethal force, and they're not always used to force compliance. They are very often used as on-the-spot punishment by police who want to teach citizens a lesson.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTake the now notorious California incident that happened to be filmed by a local news station, in which a man on horseback led police on a chase through the desert. When he fell from the horse, police swarmed and he very clearly laid down on his stomach and put his hands behind his back. Then the police beat the hell out of him and tasered him repeatedly. This footage has garnered widespread criticism because of the beating, and for good reason. It's brutal, primitive behavior.\n\nBut you won't find many people expressing outrage about the electric shocks being administered to this man over and over again. Here's a typical news report of the incident:\n\nIn video captured by cameras aboard a helicopter for KNBC, deputies gather around the man after he falls from a horse he was riding to flee from them. The video shows deputies using a stun gun on him and then repeatedly kicking and hitting him. KNBC reported that the man -- identified by authorities as Francis Pusok -- appeared to be kicked 17 times, punched 37 times and hit with a baton four times.\n\nAgain, if you look at the footage, Pusok was on the ground, face down with his hands behind his back before anyone tasered him or physically assaulted him. And yet the tasering is apparently considered a-ok. At the very least, it isn't mentioned as something that shocks the conscience the way the beating does.Perhaps this is because the searing pain of electro-shock doesn't leave much in the way of a mark. But hideously painful it is. Yet for some reason, delivering this particular agony to a suspect is not something people reject when there is no danger to police or bystanders, and the suspect is compliant. But police do it routinely, and are rarely sanctioned for it.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSome of this undoubtedly stems from the fact that popular culture has turned tasering into slapstick comedy. Movies and TV shows and countless Youtube videos portray it as a hilarious joke. \"Don't tase me bro\" became as national catch phrase. But it's not funny. Tasers can kill people. And regardless of what level of respect and compliance one thinks police are entitled to get from the public, they are not entitled to torture and punish citizens to teach them a lesson.\n\nWalter Scott ran from the pain of the taser and he was shot in the back numerous times for doing it. Francis Pusok was compliant and was tasered and beaten repeatedly anyway. It appears that such shootings and beatings, when captured on film anyway, are still considered beyond the pale in America these days. In both cases, officers will have to face some sanction for their behavior. Slager is facing a murder charge. It's unknown what the California cops will face, but the FBI is investigating, so there may be some federal civil rights charges. It will be very interesting if any of the officers are charged with assault for using the taser. Let's just say it will be among the vast minority of cases ever brought if they are.",

         "NEW YORK ( ███ ) - Support for U.S. President Donald Trump increased slightly among Republicans after he lashed out on Twitter over the weekend in a racially charged attack on four minority Democratic congresswomen , a ███/Ipsos public opinion poll shows .\nThe national survey , conducted on Monday and Tuesday after Trump told the lawmakers they should “ go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came , ” showed his net approval among members of his Republican Party rose by 5 percentage points to 72 % , compared with a similar poll that ran last week .\nTrump , who is seeking re-election next year , has lost support , however , with Democrats and independents since the Sunday tweetstorm .\nAmong independents , about three out of 10 said they approved of Trump , down from four out of 10 a week ago . His net approval - the percentage who approve minus the percentage who disapprove - dropped by 2 points among Democrats in the poll .\nTrump ’ s overall approval remained unchanged over the past week . According to the poll , 41 % of the U.S. public said they approved of his performance in office , while 55 % disapproved .\nThe results showed strong Republican backing for Trump as the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives passed a symbolic resolution on Tuesday , largely along party lines , to condemn him for “ racist comments ” against the four Democratic lawmakers .\nAll four U.S. representatives - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , Ilhan Omar of Minnesota , Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan - are U.S. citizens . Three were born in the United States .\nThe public response to Trump ’ s statements appeared to be a little better for him than in 2017 , after the president said there were “ very fine people ” on both sides of a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville , Virginia .\nIn that instance , Trump ’ s net approval dropped by about 10 points a week after the Charlottesville rally .\nThis time , while Democrats and some independents may see clear signs of racial intolerance woven throughout Trump ’ s tweets , Republicans are hearing a different message , said Vincent Hutchings , a political science and African-American studies professor at the University of Michigan .\n“ To Republicans , Trump is simply saying : ‘ Hey , if you don ’ t like America , you can leave , ” Hutchings said . “ That is not at all controversial . If you already support Trump , then it ’ s very easy to interpret his comments that way . ”\nBy criticizing liberal members of the House , Trump is “ doing exactly what Republicans want him to do , ” Hutchings said . “ He ’ s taking on groups that they oppose . ”\nThe ███/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English and gathered responses from 1,113 adults , including 478 Democrats and 406 Republicans in the United States . It has a credibility interval , a measure of precision , of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 points for Democrats or Republicans .",

According to the poll, 41% of the U.S. public said they approved of his performance in office, while 55% disapproved.\n\nThe results showed strong Republican backing for Trump as the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives passed a symbolic resolution on Tuesday, largely along party lines, to condemn him for “racist comments” against the four Democratic lawmakers.\n\nAll four U.S. representatives - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan - are U.S. citizens. Three were born in the United States.\n\nThe public response to Trump’s statements appeared to be a little better for him than in 2017, after the president said there were “very fine people” on both sides of a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nIn that instance, Trump’s net approval dropped by about 10 points a week after the Charlottesville rally.\n\nThis time, while Democrats and some independents may see clear signs of racial intolerance woven throughout Trump’s tweets, Republicans are hearing a different message, said Vincent Hutchings, a political science and African-American studies professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 16, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\n“To Republicans, Trump is simply saying: ‘Hey, if you don’t like America, you can leave,” Hutchings said. “That is not at all controversial. If you already support Trump, then it’s very easy to interpret his comments that way.”\n\nBy criticizing liberal members of the House, Trump is “doing exactly what Republicans want him to do,” Hutchings said. “He’s taking on groups that they oppose.”\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English and gathered responses from 1,113 adults, including 478 Democrats and 406 Republicans in the United States. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 points for Democrats or Republicans.",

         "Six bullets . More than I can count on one hand . That is how many times preliminary autopsy reports indicate that Michael Brown was shot . Nothing about the youthful infraction of strolling down the middle of a residential street in one ’ s own neighborhood justifies having your life ripped away from you by an irate officer firing six bullets as you face him , hands up in surrender .\nI can not even fathom what Mike , “ Big Mike ” as his friends call him , felt as each of those bullets entered his flesh . I do know a little of the rage , despair , helplessness and hopelessness that black communities have been left to feel in the aftermath of his death . I know he stayed conscious long enough to put his hands up , to try and surrender , as if to say , “ I want to live . Please don ’ t kill me . ”\nFerguson residents and protesters now find themselves arms outstretched , palms up , yelling “ don ’ t shoot , ” as police officers in guns , gas masks and tanks occupy the streets of Ferguson , Missouri , dropping canisters of tear gas on our American dreams . Those of us not yet there in Ferguson watch helplessly as the images of at least one child being tear-gassed come through our Twitter feeds , as journalists find themselves facing down the barrel of a hastily drawn police weapon or thrown in jail , as police drop stun grenades on crowds that refuse to comply with the unreasonable demand that they relinquish their right to peaceful assembly .\nWhile the world watches aghast , America ’ s penchant for exporting guns , tanks and destruction to other places in the name of law and order has shown up on our own doorsteps , in our backyards , with people pinned into parking lots and onto their porches . They are told they must stay where they are or risk being shot with rubber bullets or have their faces and lungs sting with the inhalation of tear gas .\nPublic space in Ferguson is awash in black tears , but it is the sirens that we hear wailing . The people would weep , but they are too busy running , ducking and taking cover from the angry sounds of a system that does not love them , does not care about their meager “ rights . ”\nMeanwhile , the government attempts to placate the people with optical sleights of hand . Capt . Ron Johnson , by all accounts a sincere and affable leader and head of the highway patrol , replaced the police chief late last week , with promises that he would not employ military tactics to police the citizens of Ferguson . On Thursday I breathed a bit easier as we watched him giving hugs to protesters , marching with the people , allowing black women of faith to lay hands on him and pray .\nThat peace was short-lived after the Ferguson police inflamed crowds by releasing irrelevant footage of a conflict that Michael Brown had at a local convenience store when he and his friend Dorian went to buy Cigarellos . Late that evening the crowds returned , only to be met by more tanks , more tear gas , more guns .\nBeyond shock , I continue to be appalled at the extensive lengths to which the police have gone to protect Officer Darren Wilson and his family from any public reproach or reprisal in Mike ’ s death . They delayed the release of his name in order to provide him enough time to leave town . They then released his name to coincide with video of the Cigarello incident , which they later admitted he knew nothing about when he stopped Mike . It is clear that the police are closing ranks , showing that they value the lives of their own more than the lives of citizens .\nWe are told repeatedly that police are worthy of our respect because they risk their lives each day to protect us . That is not the case for black people . When we encounter police , our lives are at risk while they protect themselves . I started to temper my statement by saying “ some police , ” but that gives the impression that I am speaking of the actions of a few rogue officers . The problem with this logic is that we now know that Ferguson law enforcement has a range of problems – disproportionate stops of black residents , disproportionately low numbers of black police ( three out of over 50 ) , and a history of antagonistic exchanges with the people of St. Louis County .\nWe have a problem of overzealous policing in this country . That problem is exacerbated by issues of race and gender , so that black men are perceived to be far more threatening than they actually are . And when black women encounter police , we are not given the protections generally afforded to white femininity . Our womanhood does not mitigate the threat of police force . This , then , is not about the actions of a rogue officer , but rather about the ideology of overpolicing that deputizes extrajudicial behavior as completely justified , as long as the life being taken or haphazardly handled is a black or brown life . Though the killing of Brown by Wilson seemingly fits a long historical script of the harassment of black people at the hands of white police officers , the reality is that overpolicing is an ideology that many police officers subscribe to regardless of color .\nThat ideology is rooted in a kind of anti-blackness that sees black bodies as a perpetual and mortal threat . Anti-black rhetoric has shown up not only from the Ferguson police but also ironically in the reporting and advocacy of everyone from CNN reporter Don Lemon to rapper Nelly , in their continued focus on issues like “ black-on-black crime ” and the necessity of keeping law and order . “ Don ’ t use your last option , first , ” Nelly told folks on St. Louis radio . There is little recognition that it is Darren Wilson who used his last option – lethal force — first . Moreover , the whole point of using tear gas and military vehicles in this small community is to force the residents into a realization that they have run out of options . Sadly , anti-black ideology can emerge even from people who are black or who otherwise love black people .\nI know Americans like to see themselves as a law and order people , but the few folks who have rioted and looted over the last few days , many of whom are reportedly not Ferguson residents , were stopped in their tracks by peaceful protesters . Even still their presence exposes an inconvenient truth . The killing of unarmed teenagers by police officers is lawlessness . It shows a lack of respect for the sanctity of life and the rule of law . The supreme irony is seeing folks defend the officer ’ s lawlessness while calling for people destroying property to respect the law .\nAs I keep saying , destruction of property is not particularly productive . But I refuse to direct my ire toward anyone but the officer who unjustly took Michael Brown ’ s life and the police establishment that is now complicit in this crime .\nI am tired . Emotionally exhausted , actually . I am tired of going to sleep each night seeing a community of people who look like me under military siege . I ’ m tired of seeing crying black mothers – Sybrina Fulton , Lucia McBath and Leslie McSpadden —distraught over the loss of their teenage sons Trayvon , Jordan and Michael . I ’ m tired of hearing report after report of people under attack from tear gas . I ’ m tired of journalists being bullied for trying to tell the truth . I ’ m tired of explaining to white people why our anger is justified , why looting , which is a property crime , should not even be part of a conversation about the killing of a teenager , why the alleged shoplifting of cigarettes is not a capital offense , why the police officer who killed Mike for the crime of walking in the street is the real thug .\nWhite racism and white privilege continue a bad cop-good cop routine with black America that is utterly exhausting . Just when we think we are making headway , a well-meaning white person asks “ but can ’ t we condemn the looting too ? ” The question is : Have you condemned the killing ? Or have you tried to explain it away ? To justify it ?\nI will not engage in a condemnation quid pro quo with trolls , well-meaning white citizens or respectable black ones , “ Brand New Negroes ” I call them , in the tradition of the famous text from Harlem Renaissance philosopher Alain Locke . I will not concede that destruction of property is equal to the taking of life . I will not answer calls to be reasonable in the face of unreasonable , unjustifiable black death . I will not believe the lie that black propriety and respectability – pulling our pants up , speaking corporate English , never , ever doing anything wrong – will save us .\nFerguson exposes the extent to which American necropolitics shapes the terms and conditions of black life in what professor Sundiata Cha-Jua calls a new racial nadir . The first racial nadir happened from about 1890 to about 1930 , when black people experienced the unprecedented loss of political gains hard won in the aftermath of the Civil War and the astronomical rise of lynching . We have indeed reached a new nadir in America ’ s racial life , one hard to fathom as a black president sits in the White House , abdicating his responsibility to speak forcefully and forthrightly to the problem of racism and military-style policing both for fear of being seen as too “ black ” and for fear of political reprisal from the right .\nMeanwhile , our voting rights have been stripped away , our kids are being killed in the streets , their killers rarely convicted , and our communities are placed under siege .

Zhang is a permanent U.S. resident .\nProsecutors also said they found documents from several of Chen ’ s former employers at his second home in Maryland . They found a 2011 document from Raytheon Co. that they later determined was classified as “ confidential . ”\n“ This document contains information relating to Raytheon ’ s work on the Patriot Missile program and was not ( and is not ) permitted to be maintained outside of Department of Defense secured locations , ” prosecutors wrote . A hearing on the case is scheduled for February .\nChen and Zhang ’ s case comes as lawmakers and government officials worry China is stealing U.S. technology . Republican Sen. Josh Hawley , for instance , introduced legislation in June seeking to prevent American researchers from using technologies developed by Chinese big tech companies .\nUniversities are “ key targets of espionage and intellectual property theft by not only China , but Russia and Iran , ” the Missouri Republican said in a statement announcing the bill . “ For too long , these countries have sent students to our universities to collect sensitive research that they can later use to develop capabilities that threaten our national security . ”\nHawley introduced a bill in May that would force President Donald Trump to restrict technology to China that would contribute to the country ’ s military . That bill would also place heavy restrictions on technology that influences artificial intelligence , semiconductors , and robots .",

They found a 2011 document from Raytheon Co. that they later determined was classified as “confidential.”\n\n“This document contains information relating to Raytheon’s work on the Patriot Missile program and was not (and is not) permitted to be maintained outside of Department of Defense secured locations,” prosecutors wrote. A hearing on the case is scheduled for February.\n\nChen and Zhang’s case comes as lawmakers and government officials worry China is stealing U.S. technology. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, for instance, introduced legislation in June seeking to prevent American researchers from using technologies developed by Chinese big tech companies.\n\nUniversities are “key targets of espionage and intellectual property theft by not only China, but Russia and Iran,” the Missouri Republican said in a statement announcing the bill. “For too long, these countries have sent students to our universities to collect sensitive research that they can later use to develop capabilities that threaten our national security.”\n\nHawley introduced a bill in May that would force President Donald Trump to restrict technology to China that would contribute to the country’s military. That bill would also place heavy restrictions on technology that influences artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and robots.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

         "In an extensive article published last month that included interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement officials , congressional officials and other government employees , the New York Times published a stinging indictment of James B. Comey ’ s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe .\nThe Times made the case that Comey violated FBI tradition , bypassed the Justice Department and went rogue on several occasions in a manner that clearly impacted the 2016 presidential election .\nIn a letter on Tuesday from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired , Rosenstein specifically cited Comey ’ s alleged mishandling of the Clinton email probe as justification for Comey ’ s removal from office .\n“ I can not defend the Director ’ s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of secretary Clinton ’ s emails , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ And I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken . Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes ; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives . ”\nRosenstein continued : “ The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General ’ s authority on July 5 , 2016 , and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution . It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement . At most , the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors . ”\nThat is precisely the case made by the Times ’ April 22 article , titled , “ Comey Tried to Shield the F.B.I . From Politics . Then He Shaped an Election . ”\nThe Times says that for its article it interviewed “ more than 30 current and former law enforcement , congressional and other government officials . ”\nThe newspaper concluded that Comey ’ s decision to inform Congress that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email probe less than two weeks before the presidential election “ violate [ ed ] the policies of an agency that does not reveal its investigations or do anything that may influence an election . ”\nThe article related that Comey decided to plunge the FBI “ into the molten center of a bitter election ” in part because he feared “ the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I . had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret . ”\nA significant motivating factor for Comey ’ s rogue approach toward the Clinton email probe , the Times revealed , was his distrust of senior officials at the Justice Department , especially then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch , whom , the newspaper reported , “ Mr . Comey believed had subtly helped play down the Clinton investigation . ”\nIndeed , according to the Times , Comey was aware of the existence of a document written by a Democratic operative that allegedly indicated Lynch would have protected Hillary Clinton in the email probe .\nThe FBI had further information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence , leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the U.S. government ’ s Clinton email probe , the Times reported .\nIn his letter from Tuesday , Rosenstein argues that if Comey believed Lynch to be compromised he should have sought her recusal instead of taking matters into his own hands .\n“ The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Lynch had a conflict , ” Rosenstein wrote . “ But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department . There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General . ”\nIndeed , according to the Times , after it became clear that the F.B.I . did not discover Clinton emails showing intent to mishandle classified information – the agency believed those emails were among the correspondence deleted by Clinton – Comey made the decision to bypass the Justice Department and explain the case to the public .\nNine months into the investigation , it became clear to Mr. Comey that Mrs. Clinton was almost certainly not going to face charges . He quietly began work on talking points , toying with the notion that in the midst of a bitter presidential campaign , a Justice Department led by Democrats may not have the credibility to close the case , and that he alone should explain that decision to the public .\nComey ’ s decision was further fueled by the alleged document written by a Democratic operative hacked by the Russians , a document that in Comey ’ s view raised “ questions about [ Lynch ’ s ] independence , ” the Times reported .\nInstead of seeking Lynch ’ s recusal , as Rosenstein would later outline as the proper course of action , Comey decided to go at it alone , take matters into his own hands and make his public pronouncements about Clinton ’ s email case without the Justice Department .\nThe Times cited former Justice officials as “ deeply skeptical ” of Comey ’ s alleged reasoning :\nFormer Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account . If Mr. Comey believed that Ms. Lynch were compromised , they say , why did he not seek her recusal ? Mr. Comey never raised this issue with Ms. Lynch or the deputy attorney general , Sally Q. Yates , former officials said .\nMr. Comey ’ s defenders regard this as one of the untold stories of the Clinton investigation , one they say helps explain his decision-making . But former Justice Department officials say the F.B.I . never uncovered evidence tying Ms. Lynch to the document ’ s author , and are convinced that Mr. Comey wanted an excuse to put himself in the spotlight .\nComey ’ s decision to go rogue was solidified , according to the Times ’ account , after Lynch ’ s infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton , the husband of the FBI ’ s main subject in a criminal probe , boarded the attorney general ’ s plane and reportedly stayed there for about twenty minutes .\nYet Comey still did not seek Lynch ’ s recusal . The Times article related that after the tarmac episode , Comey “ knew for sure that when there was something to say about the case , he alone would say it . ”\nAfterwards , Comey held the press conference at which he criticized Clinton ’ s private email server as “ extremely careless ” before finally stating that “ no charges are appropriate in this case . ”\nWith his pronouncements , Comey offered judgments and legal conclusions many argue are out of the purview of the FBI , which is charged with documenting the evidence and handing it over to the Justice Department .\nThe Times cited unnamed “ frustrated ” prosecutors at the Justice Department complaining that Comey should have first consulted with them .\nComey ’ s injection into the presidential race did not end there . Less than two weeks before the election , the FBI discovered a trove of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of long-time top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin . Some of the emails , according to reports , originated on Clinton ’ s old BlackBerry server that she used before setting up her private home server and some believe may have contained the deleted messages .\nComey ’ s decision centered on whether to follow FBI tradition and keep quiet about the reopening of the case , or inform Congress about the ongoing investigation , which , the Times related , “ everyone acknowledged would create a political furor . ”\nEventually , Comey decided to go rogue again and inform Congress .\nLynch was against the decision , the Times reported , and the Justice Department implored the FBI not to impact the presidential campaign in its final days . The Times reported that “ even at the F.B.I. , agents who supported their high-profile director were stunned . ”\n“ Career prosecutors and political appointees ” at the Justice Department quietly criticized not only Comey but Lynch for failing to stop the FBI director , the Times documented .\nA chorus of former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from across the political spectrum publicly criticized Comey ’ s move . For example , Jamie S. Gorelick , who served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration , opined that Comey was “ damaging our democracy . ”\nWriting in the Washington Post on October 29 , Gorelick slammed Comey ’ s decision to so publicly reopen the case just before the election as “ antithetical to the interests of justice , putting a thumb on the scale of this election and damaging our democracy . ”\nGorelick co-authored the Washington Post opinion piece , titled , “ James Comey is damaging our democracy , ” with Larry Thompson , who served under the George W.

         "“ Trump has betrayed the Syrian Kurds ” — so goes a popular refrain regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the areas of northeast Syria held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) . The events that have followed — namely , a Turkish invasion of parts of SDF territory along the border and the deployment of Syrian government forces in some SDF areas — have been characterized as a strategic disaster for American interests , with some commentators even proclaiming the withdrawal as indicative of a U.S. imperial decline and U.S. disengagement from the Middle East .\nIn fact , much of this is overblown . For one thing , the U.S. still maintains extensive troop deployments elsewhere in the Middle East , and those are not being drawn down anytime soon . Insofar as many of the pundits , analysts , and policymakers condemning Trump consider the recent developments in Syria to be a disaster , they primarily have themselves to blame , however popular bashing Trump might be .\nIndeed , these critics of Trump did not learn the relevant lessons from December 2018 when the president ordered preparations for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria . They should have appreciated that Trump is ultimately the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces and that he had made his own preferences on Syria clear : namely , that after the military defeat of the Islamic State , U.S. forces should leave . As the president ’ s record on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal illustrates , he has generally been forthright and sincere in trying to fulfill his policy promises . When he told his advisers that he wanted to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria , he meant it . The message should have been clear : devise an orderly withdrawal plan .\nBut that is not what happened . Instead , efforts and attention were geared towards U.S. forces remaining indefinitely in Syria . The advocates for this “ stay indefinitely ” approach argued that the deployment as it existed was supposedly an example of a successful projection of U.S. leverage and influence with a relatively small number of troops . They claimed that U.S. presence was vital for political negotiations on Syria ’ s future and important for limiting Iranian influence and blocking its “ land route ” to the Mediterranean .\nIn reality , none of these assertions holds up but rather reflect dubious expansions of the original purpose of the U.S. mission in Syria : countering the Islamic State . At the same time , the “ stay indefinitely ” crowd tended to downplay the major problem regarding the U.S. partnership with the SDF : the issue of relations with Turkey , which considers ( with some justification ) the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , which has fought the Turkish state for decades .\nRegardless of what one thinks of Turkey ’ s approach towards the PKK , it is not a problem that can be treated as a minor irritant . Facts of geography mean that Turkey is located along the northern borders of the SDF ’ s territory . As such , Turkey could be the SDF ’ s main gateway to the outside world , rather than the small and limited capacity border crossing on the Tigris River that the SDF has maintained with the Iraqi Kurdistan region .

This view is implausible . A small foreign troop presence can function as a deterrent to another side ’ s attack , but it is not an absolute deterrent here . To understand why , consider events that occurred earlier this year on the other side of Syria . In the northwest of Syria ( specifically the city of Idlib and its environs ) , Turkey set up multiple small military outposts in the insurgent-held areas ostensibly as part of enforcing a “ deescalation ” scheme in coordination with Russia . In practice , the goal has been to block any further Syrian government offensives on the northwest and prevent further refugee flows into Turkey .\nWhile Russia has shown some understanding of Turkey ’ s concerns in this regard , it also wishes to assist the Syrian government in restoring its control over the area and will not tolerate the indefinite presence of designated “ terrorist ” groups harassing Syrian government and Russian positions . Russia thus gave Turkey time to clear a demilitarized buffer zone of the likes of Hay ’ at Tahrir al-Sham ( a designated “ terrorist ” group ) . When that did not materialize and the insurgent harassments of Syrian government and Russian positions continued , the Syrian government and Russia launched a military campaign that retook important areas in south Idlib and north Hama . The Turkish military outposts did not do anything to stop the offensive ( indeed , they could not do so ) , and in effect the Syrian government and Russia worked around one of the outposts in north Hama . A ceasefire then followed , but it should be clear that it will not last if Turkey can not crack down on the groups that are designated as “ terrorist . ”\nThat episode should also have been a lesson for U.S. policymakers . Turkey ’ s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly said he would launch an incursion against the SDF to the east of the Euphrates River ( where U.S. forces in Syria have primarily been stationed ) , and in 2018 Turkey had carried through with its threats to destroy the SDF enclave in the Afrin area , where the U.S. had no presence . What would have stopped Turkey from finding ways to work around U.S. positions as part of its incursion against the SDF east of the Euphrates River and essentially forcing the small U.S. garrisons — confronted by much larger Turkish forces and their Syrian insurgent proxies — to get out of the way ?\nThus , Trump ’ s indication to Erdoğan that he wished to leave Syria and would not oppose an incursion likely hastened the Turkish operations against the SDF . But it was not the decisive factor in determining whether or not those operations would have eventually occurred anyway . Had the U.S. wished to deter Turkey indefinitely , it would have had to deploy far more troops in northeast Syria . For comparison , the much more extensive Turkish military presence in the insurgent-held north Aleppo countryside between Afrin and Jarabulus functions as an effective deterrent against Russian and Syrian government military action so long as Turkey maintains that large presence .\nOf course , the advocates of the “ stay indefinitely ” course did not dare to confront these realities and argue for a more extensive U.S. presence , knowing that such advocacy would be politically unacceptable . They preferred to argue that the small U.S. troop presence in northeast Syria as an example of a deployment that was strategically effective and inexpensive .\nUltimately , the debate about the U.S. role in Syria boils down to the question of how far the U.S. should invest troops and resources into a foreign deployment . Those who advocated an indefinite presence are delusional if they think the prior status quo was sustainable . If they had thought more carefully about the idea of making the SDF-held areas a U.S. protectorate that could function independently of the wider environment , they should have accepted that such a project would have required far more troops and money to be poured in .\nIn any case , they should still be asked why they did not come up with an exit plan but instead thought they could defy the president ’ s wishes .

         "“Trump has betrayed the Syrian Kurds” — so goes a popular refrain regarding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the areas of northeast Syria held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The events that have followed — namely, a Turkish invasion of parts of SDF territory along the border and the deployment of Syrian government forces in some SDF areas — have been characterized as a strategic disaster for American interests, with some commentators even proclaiming the withdrawal as indicative of a U.S. imperial decline and U.S. disengagement from the Middle East.\n\n\n\nIn fact, much of this is overblown. For one thing, the U.S. still maintains extensive troop deployments elsewhere in the Middle East, and those are not being drawn down anytime soon. Insofar as many of the pundits, analysts, and policymakers condemning Trump consider the recent developments in Syria to be a disaster, they primarily have themselves to blame, however popular bashing Trump might be.\n\nIndeed, these critics of Trump did not learn the relevant lessons from December 2018 when the president ordered preparations for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria. They should have appreciated that Trump is ultimately the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces and that he had made his own preferences on Syria clear: namely, that after the military defeat of the Islamic State, U.S. forces should leave. As the president’s record on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal illustrates, he has generally been forthright and sincere in trying to fulfill his policy promises. When he told his advisers that he wanted to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, he meant it. The message should have been clear: devise an orderly withdrawal plan.\n\nBut that is not what happened. Instead, efforts and attention were geared towards U.S. forces remaining indefinitely in Syria. The advocates for this “stay indefinitely” approach argued that the deployment as it existed was supposedly an example of a successful projection of U.S. leverage and influence with a relatively small number of troops. They claimed that U.S. presence was vital for political negotiations on Syria’s future and important for limiting Iranian influence and blocking its “land route” to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn reality, none of these assertions holds up but rather reflect dubious expansions of the original purpose of the U.S. mission in Syria: countering the Islamic State. At the same time, the “stay indefinitely” crowd tended to downplay the major problem regarding the U.S. partnership with the SDF: the issue of relations with Turkey, which considers (with some justification) the SDF to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought the Turkish state for decades.\n\nRegardless of what one thinks of Turkey’s approach towards the PKK, it is not a problem that can be treated as a minor irritant. Facts of geography mean that Turkey is located along the northern borders of the SDF’s territory. As such, Turkey could be the SDF’s main gateway to the outside world, rather than the small and limited capacity border crossing on the Tigris River that the SDF has maintained with the Iraqi Kurdistan region. Thus, for the interests of the SDF’s longterm economic prospects (among other things), some kind of détente or resolution of the conflict between the PKK and Turkey would have been necessary so that the region could have much more open borders and engagement with the outside world.\n\nUnfortunately, though, policymakers and advisers did not take Turkey’s concerns and its threats of a military confrontation with the SDF seriously enough. Along with their desire to keep U.S. troops in Syria, many of them imagined that Turkey could somehow be appeased through half-baked measures: thus the previous attempts to deny SDF–PKK links, the failed schemes of joint U.S.–Turkish patrols in the Manbij area west of the Euphrates River, and then the joint northern border patrols and partial dismantling of SDF fortifications along the northern border with Turkey a little while before the recent Turkish incursion against the SDF.\n\nOthers argue that the U.S. simply needed to be adamant in saying no to a Turkish incursion and that the small U.S. troop presence could have deterred Turkey indefinitely. This view is implausible. A small foreign troop presence can function as a deterrent to another side’s attack, but it is not an absolute deterrent here.

         "Overruling objections by everyone from Indiana business leaders to actor George Takei , GOP Gov . Mike Pence on Thursday signed legislation that will allow individuals and businesses in the state to deny services to LGBT people on `` religious liberty '' grounds .\n`` The Constitution of the United States and the Indiana Constitution both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion , but today , many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action , '' Pence said in signing the law .\nAlthough Pence , a fervent social conservative , had signaled earlier this week that he would sign the legislation , LGBT rights advocates hoped to derail it with a last-ditch pressure campaign . Leading corporations in the state -- including Salesforce and Cummins -- came out against the measure , arguing that sanctioning anti-LGBT discrimination would damage the state 's reputation and its ability to recruit a talented workforce .

         "Overruling objections by everyone from Indiana business leaders to actor George Takei, GOP Gov. Mike Pence on Thursday signed legislation that will allow individuals and businesses in the state to deny services to LGBT people on \"religious liberty\" grounds.\n\n\"The Constitution of the United States and the Indiana Constitution both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion, but today, many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action,\" Pence said in signing the law.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAlthough Pence, a fervent social conservative, had signaled earlier this week that he would sign the legislation, LGBT rights advocates hoped to derail it with a last-ditch pressure campaign. Leading corporations in the state -- including Salesforce and Cummins -- came out against the measure, arguing that sanctioning anti-LGBT discrimination would damage the state's reputation and its ability to recruit a talented workforce. Takei, meanwhile, vowed to boycott the upcoming GenCon gaming convention in Indianapolis if Pence signed the legislation, and GenCon's CEO warned the governor that the legislation \"will factor into our decision-making on hosting the convention in the state of Indiana in future years.\"\n\nThe Disciples of Christ, a liberal denomination, joined the outcry, declaring that it would relocate its General Assembly, which was slated to be held in Indianapolis in 2017.\n\nThe legislation Pence signed bars states and localities from \"substantially burdening\" individuals' religious freedoms in the absence of a compelling government interest. Lawmakers throughout the country have proposed such \"religious liberty\" measures with the intent of allowing business owners and individuals to discriminate against LGBT people on religious grounds.\n\nLaws like Indiana's promise to serve as rallying cries for the religious right in the years to come, as conservatives grapple with the imminence of nationwide marriage equality and seek other ways to undermine legal protections for the LGBT community.

         "Jim Acosta of CNN and other media personalities get exercised when the President calls Fake News the “ enemy of the people. ” President Trump does not call all news outlets or personalities by that term — only the Fake News . Certainly , that term is quite an incendiary sobriquet . The President reciprocates with it because he gets attacked with incendiary abuse . No American President in memory has been picked on and lied about with the intensity and frequency that President Trump has had to endure .\nThe media — because it is almost-monolithically Left-Democrat — regularly depicted Ronald Reagan as a moron , occasionally tying him to a movie in which he acted , Bedtime for Bonzo , where he went to bed in one scene alongside a chimpanzee . ( They forget that he was cast in the film as a university professor . ) Reagan endured it , avoided reciprocal name-calling , and history unequivocally has registered that he actually was quite brilliant , understood what so many others could not grasp , revived the moribund Jimmy Carter economy with creative strategies and tax-cutting boldness that George H.W . Bush myopically had called “ Voodoo Economics , ” stared down Mikhail Gorbachev and defeated a century of Communism , and launched an anti-ballistic military focus that his enemies mocked as “ Star Wars ” but that today is central to protecting Western democracies from incoming ballistic missiles . The “ Iron Dome ” missile-defense system that Israel has used so effectively against Gaza Hamas terrorist rockets is the fruit of “ Star Wars . ”\nThe Left Media almost universally depicted the brilliant Reagan as an idiot , and he somehow shrugged it off . Donald Trump is different because we do not manufacture our Presidents with interchangeable parts on an assembly line . It very well may be that the past week ’ s Pittsburgh terrorist attack , and the way the President responded , and the way the Left Media then hit the President viciously anyway is the “ Rosetta Stone ” — the small piece of archaeological evidence historians will need — to decipher that Donald Trump was right to call the Fake News Left Media the “ enemy of the people . ”\n1 . “ The People ” Benefit From a Robust and Independent Press — and a Fake News Regime Indeed Is the Enemy of the People\n“ The People ” indeed benefit from a robust “ press ” — more accurately called “ media ” in this digital age of televised news , digital internet-based news , and so much more than the mere newsprint “ press. ” If Stalin ’ s Soviet Russia had been covered by a robust media ( and if such media could have survived ) , “ The People ” would have learned that Stalin ’ s five-year economic plans disastrously were failing and were leading to mass starvation , moreover that he consciously was perpetrating genocide by starving millions of Ukrainians to death in the Golodomor , that he was putting millions of prisoners to work in tundra prisons to dig through ice manually to build canals and other infrastructure . An honest news media would have alerted the West , too , that Stalin was murdering millions . The New York Times had a sycophantically pro-Stalin liar , Walter Duranty , filing Fake News reports from the Soviet Union for more than ten years . The Times published the lies daily as “ news ” and made him their Moscow bureau chief for fourteen years . As a result , the West was lulled , cheated of the truth , made unaware of the evil . Yes , the Fake News indeed was the enemy of the people .\nLikewise , the New York Times— and the other mainstream media who took their lead from them — by and large refused to report on the unfolding Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews . Between 1939 and 1945 , the New York Times published more than 23,000 front-page stories . Of those , 11,500 were about World War II . Only twenty-six — in six years — were about the Holocaust . The Times was passively complicit .\nA robust newsmedia can save lives by exposing and revealing , while a Fake News regime can serve to assist in the despoiling of a people . When media foist false narratives to sow social discord , or when they assist tyranny with falsehoods , they indeed are the enemy of the people .\nSocial discord leads to streets being set on fire — witness Ferguson and Baltimore during the Obama Years . Social discord dispirits potentially valuable citizens who could help build a society , instead turning them against that society and motivating them to work towards its downfall or simply to drop out . In its worst aspect , social discord leads to armed insurrection and civil war . If the problem is that a Stalin is murdering millions by deliberately starving them while incarcerating millions others in slave camps in the Gulag , then insurrection and civil war can be righteous , potentially saving such a despoiled society . But when the society actually is doing quite well , when freedom reigns and people of all colors , creeds , religions , and ethnicities are enjoying remarkable opportunities to succeed and to live wonderfully rich and precious lives alongside their neighbors in respectful diversity , then Fake News media indeed are the enemy of the people when they seek to sow social discord in that welcome environment , aiming to up-end civil harmony .\nA maniacal dirtbag murdered eleven Jews in Pittsburgh . In time , perhaps after a decade or two of ACLU appeals , he will be electrocuted , injected , hanged , or hopefully all three . The dirtbag hated Jews , and he likewise hated President Trump . President Trump responded to the news immediately with profoundly sensitive and healing words aimed at condemning anti-Semitism and at comforting and consoling the Jewish community . Listen to his words . If the role of a President is to heal and unify , as President Reagan did after the Challenger tragedy , as President Bush did after 9-11 , then this President did so eloquently , sensitively . And then came the sowers of social discord to destroy the moment… .\nThe Left Media would not allow the President that moment to heal and unify . Instantly , they brought in one Left-Democrat anti-Trump “ analyst ” after another to blame Mr. Trump for the attack . They never blamed President Jimmy Carter ’ s anti-Jewish rhetoric for the 1977 Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue shooting in St. Louis . Nor Bill Clinton for the 1994 Brooklyn Bridge shootings of yeshiva students that included the murder of Ari Halberstam . Nor Clinton ’ s rhetoric for the 1999 Granada Hills Jewish Community Center shooting in Los Angeles . Nor Obama for the deadly 2009 Holocaust Museum shooting in Washington , D.C . Nor Obama for the 2014 Overland Park Jewish Community Center shootings in Kansas City that murdered three . But this time — with the same social dynamics as the others — they tried blaming the President . By sowing social discord with outright absolute falsehoods at a time that called for healing , the Left Media indeed were acting as enemy of the people .\nFacts are different from opinions . Facts can be discerned and evidenced . There is a reason that as many as 82 percent of Israeli Jews love President Trump , that more than 90 percent of American Orthodox Jews support President Trump . Likewise , a huge majority of British Jews — by more than three-to-one — support England ’ s conservative party and despise the Labour Socialists . Similarly , millions of Jews who have left the former Soviet Union hate Marxism and socialism , are solidly capitalist and conservative , indeed have changed the face of Israeli politics towards the more conservative Likud , now led by Benjamin Netanyahu . Throughout the world , Jews now vote conservative , are conservative — as reflected in our country , too , by American Orthodox Jews . The independent Pew Research Center has found that the Orthodox Jewish community will be the predominant Jewish community in a few decades , as the others disappear . Just as the voting patterns of the American Deep South have changed 180 degrees from Democrat to Republican in the century since the Civil War , so is the American Jewish metamorphosis now on pace to synchronize with every other Jewish community in the world that has moved towards conservatism . But Jews are not monolithic , as witness those in Hollywood and in certain media .\nSo look at what the Fake News Left Media did after President Trump healed and unified : They received a news release from a small , utterly insignificant , nothing of a Radical Leftist group , calling itself “ Bend the Arc , ” which said that they did not want the President of the United States to visit Pittsburgh . The thing is , those Radical Leftists do not want the President to visit anywhere . Just as there are rabid Leftist Catholics ( not to mention the more mainstream Leftist Nancy Pelosi , Joe Biden , and the Kennedys ) and rabid Leftist Protestants , these also are rabid Leftists . Within the normative mainstream American Jewish community , “ Bend the Arc ” is a joke , off the charts . Their CEO started off as a sex-club “ dancer. ” C ’ mon ! As reported : “ Cotler , who identifies as queer , recounted how a lesbian couple invited her to their [ event ] after she did a table dance for them at what she refers to as a ‘ sex club. ’ ” Feh !\nSo this Leftist fringe group issues their statement — and the Fake News Left Media then falsely report that “ the Jews of Pittsburgh ” ( not “ some Jews ” ) do not want the President to visit . Consider these headlines — and they are a mere sampling :\n“ ‘ You Are Not Welcome ’ : Jewish Community Leaders Do Not Want President Trump To Come To Pittsburgh ” ( Salon )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Stay Away Unless He Denounces White Nationalism ” ( NY Daily News )\n“ Trump ‘ Not Welcome ’ In Pittsburgh After Synagogue Shooting ” ( Al Jazeera )\n“ Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Denounce White Nationalism ” ( Reuters )\nAll those stories thereupon cite the same insignificant radical-fringe “ Bend the Arc ” statement . Honestly — if there still is such a thing as honesty — that is outright Fake News . I know the American Jewish community . I have been a Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America , a congregational rabbi for decades , sat for six years during this past decade on the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America , have sat on committees of Jewish Federations and Boards of Hillels , have a whole lifetime résumé in this area . My rabbinical colleagues and I were bristling all day , reading and hearing this Fake News . The rabbi of the temple where the murders happened , Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers , explicitly welcomed a visit by the President . To report such lies , at a time of such intense passion , is to stoke flames among the populace . It is not unfair to call such liars “ Enemies of the People . ”\nThey do it similarly to convince Americans of Color that this President hates them . He beams so proudly that he has helped reduce poverty and unemployment in the African-American community . Likewise , in the Latino and Greater Hispanic communities . It is a hallmark of his every speech . How compare him to Hitler , for G-d ’ s sakes ? Why sow social discord between and among races when the President , despite his classical Trumpian gaffes , actually takes so much pride in his being a President for all Americans , in a country where — in his trademark line — “ we all bleed the same red , white , and blue ” ? Why denigrate his outreach to Black Americans , whether via Kanye West and Jim Brown or by speaking to a Young Black Leadership Summit ? Why begin narrating his Presidency on Day One by reporting falsely , as Zeke Miller of Time magazine did , the lie that he had removed a bust of the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office ? Why publish falsehoods to sow discord among the Black and Latino communities — if not to aim cynically to peel away their votes — by trying falsely to report that he is a bigot who hates them ? Here is a man who was in the public eye , in the world ’ s media center in the heart of Manhattan , with a weekly network television show , building skyscrapers and hotels , golf courses and casinos — all bearing his name — and no stain of racism or bigotry of such sort ever got attached to him through all those decades in the limelight . Why cause enmity and divide the nation , disillusion African Americans and Latinos from recognizing that this President seeks their advancement alongside that of everyone else ? Only to sow civil discord , to promote tension and unrest in the name of advancing an agenda that assures greater television ratings , higher advertising dollars , and a change in the elected government chosen of The People , by The People , and for The People .\n3 . The Proof the Pudding : Tagging the Most Pro-Jewish President in American History as an Anti-Semite .\nSo it comes back to the Rosetta Stone — the way the Left Media falsely portrays this President ’ s relationship with one demographic , the Jews , demonstrating a pattern of Left Media mendacity aimed at sowing social discord throughout . Even before he was elected President , the Left Media was calling him an anti-Semite by clutching at straws to prove the false narrative . Just as they did by propping up “ Bend the Arc ” into a Fake News depiction as “ Jewish Leaders , ” they regularly dig up the most irrelevant and unrepresentative people from the Far Left who are JINOs— Jews In Name Only — as “ experts ” on Trump and anti-Semitism . It does not end . These are lies , damned lies , and more damned lies being perpetuated by enemies of the people . Just consider these facts about the Trump Administration and the Jews :\nThis is an anti-Semite ? If so , may G-d smite us with an abundance of such anti-Semites ! Although his daughter , Ivanka , and son-in-law Jared Kushner are Orthodox Jews — as are their children , his grandchildren — that family connection in itself is not determinative . After all , we are told that George Soros is a Jew , and most every Jew I know would gladly trade Soros for two anti-Semites and a neo-Nazi to be named later . Soros is a major opponent of Israel and secretly funds organizations that oppose critical Israel policies . But the demonstrated life record of President Trump , a lifetime of working closely with Jews , amicably and warmly , makes him someone whom Jews throughout the world appreciate deeply . Again — every survey and poll of Jews who actually live the Jewish observances , the kosher laws , the Sabbath , the Torah demonstrates that he is warmly regarded in that community .\nThe Fake News about Trump and Jews is the Rosetta Stone . Once one cracks that hidden code , everything else becomes clear . The Left Media indeed propound Fake News , lies , and falsehoods . They undertake to stoke anger among African Americans , among Latinos , among women . The People rely on them for the news , the truth — and , yes , for honest reporting when the President is wrong because The People benefit when they are told the truth , even when the truth is not pretty . But to depict him as an agent of Putin , as a man perpetrating treason , a hater ?\nThese are the lies that come only from Enemies of the People .",

Nor Obama for the 2014 Overland Park Jewish Community Center shootings in Kansas City that murdered three. But this time — with the same social dynamics as the others — they tried blaming the President. By sowing social discord with outright absolute falsehoods at a time that called for healing, the Left Media indeed were acting as enemy of the people.\n\nFacts are different from opinions. Facts can be discerned and evidenced. There is a reason that as many as 82 percent of Israeli Jews love President Trump, that more than 90 percent of American Orthodox Jews support President Trump. Likewise, a huge majority of British Jews — by more than three-to-one — support England’s conservative party and despise the Labour Socialists. Similarly, millions of Jews who have left the former Soviet Union hate Marxism and socialism, are solidly capitalist and conservative, indeed have changed the face of Israeli politics towards the more conservative Likud, now led by Benjamin Netanyahu. Throughout the world, Jews now vote conservative, are conservative — as reflected in our country, too, by American Orthodox Jews. The independent Pew Research Center has found that the Orthodox Jewish community will be the predominant Jewish community in a few decades, as the others disappear. Just as the voting patterns of the American Deep South have changed 180 degrees from Democrat to Republican in the century since the Civil War, so is the American Jewish metamorphosis now on pace to synchronize with every other Jewish community in the world that has moved towards conservatism. But Jews are not monolithic, as witness those in Hollywood and in certain media.\n\nSo look at what the Fake News Left Media did after President Trump healed and unified: They received a news release from a small, utterly insignificant, nothing of a Radical Leftist group, calling itself “Bend the Arc,” which said that they did not want the President of the United States to visit Pittsburgh. The thing is, those Radical Leftists do not want the President to visit anywhere. Just as there are rabid Leftist Catholics (not to mention the more mainstream Leftist Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, and the Kennedys) and rabid Leftist Protestants, these also are rabid Leftists. Within the normative mainstream American Jewish community, “Bend the Arc” is a joke, off the charts. Their CEO started off as a sex-club “dancer.” C’mon! As reported: “Cotler, who identifies as queer, recounted how a lesbian couple invited her to their [event] after she did a table dance for them at what she refers to as a ‘sex club.’” Feh!\n\nSo this Leftist fringe group issues their statement — and the Fake News Left Media then falsely report that “the Jews of Pittsburgh” (not “some Jews”) do not want the President to visit. Consider these headlines — and they are a mere sampling:\n\n“‘You Are Not Welcome’: Jewish Community Leaders Do Not Want President Trump To Come To Pittsburgh” (Salon)\n\n“Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Stay Away Unless He Denounces White Nationalism” (NY Daily News)\n\n“Trump ‘Not Welcome’ In Pittsburgh After Synagogue Shooting” (Al Jazeera)\n\n“Pittsburgh Jewish Leaders Tell Trump To Denounce White Nationalism” (Reuters)\n\nAll those stories thereupon cite the same insignificant radical-fringe “Bend the Arc” statement. Honestly — if there still is such a thing as honesty — that is outright Fake News. I know the American Jewish community. I have been a Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America, a congregational rabbi for decades, sat for six years during this past decade on the Executive Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America, have sat on committees of Jewish Federations and Boards of Hillels, have a whole lifetime résumé in this area. My rabbinical colleagues and I were bristling all day, reading and hearing this Fake News. The rabbi of the temple where the murders happened, Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers, explicitly welcomed a visit by the President. To report such lies, at a time of such intense passion, is to stoke flames among the populace. It is not unfair to call such liars “Enemies of the People.”\n\nThey do it similarly to convince Americans of Color that this President hates them. He beams so proudly that he has helped reduce poverty and unemployment in the African-American community. Likewise, in the Latino and Greater Hispanic communities. It is a hallmark of his every speech. How compare him to Hitler, for G-d’s sakes? Why sow social discord between and among races when the President, despite his classical Trumpian gaffes, actually takes so much pride in his being a President for all Americans, in a country where — in his trademark line — “we all bleed the same red, white, and blue”? Why denigrate his outreach to Black Americans, whether via Kanye West and Jim Brown or by speaking to a Young Black Leadership Summit? Why begin narrating his Presidency on Day One by reporting falsely, as Zeke Miller of Time magazine did, the lie that he had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office? Why publish falsehoods to sow discord among the Black and Latino communities — if not to aim cynically to peel away their votes — by trying falsely to report that he is a bigot who hates them? Here is a man who was in the public eye, in the world’s media center in the heart of Manhattan, with a weekly network television show, building skyscrapers and hotels, golf courses and casinos — all bearing his name — and no stain of racism or bigotry of such sort ever got attached to him through all those decades in the limelight. Why cause enmity and divide the nation, disillusion African Americans and Latinos from recognizing that this President seeks their advancement alongside that of everyone else? Only to sow civil discord, to promote tension and unrest in the name of advancing an agenda that assures greater television ratings, higher advertising dollars, and a change in the elected government chosen of The People, by The People, and for The People.\n\n3. The Proof the Pudding: Tagging the Most Pro-Jewish President in American History as an Anti-Semite.\n\nSo it comes back to the Rosetta Stone — the way the Left Media falsely portrays this President’s relationship with one demographic, the Jews, demonstrating a pattern of Left Media mendacity aimed at sowing social discord throughout. Even before he was elected President, the Left Media was calling him an anti-Semite by clutching at straws to prove the false narrative. Just as they did by propping up “Bend the Arc” into a Fake News depiction as “Jewish Leaders,” they regularly dig up the most irrelevant and unrepresentative people from the Far Left who are JINOs— Jews In Name Only — as “experts” on Trump and anti-Semitism. It does not end. These are lies, damned lies, and more damned lies being perpetuated by enemies of the people. Just consider these facts about the Trump Administration and the Jews:\n\nThis is an anti-Semite? If so, may G-d smite us with an abundance of such anti-Semites! Although his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner are Orthodox Jews — as are their children, his grandchildren — that family connection in itself is not determinative. After all, we are told that George Soros is a Jew, and most every Jew I know would gladly trade Soros for two anti-Semites and a neo-Nazi to be named later. Soros is a major opponent of Israel and secretly funds organizations that oppose critical Israel policies. But the demonstrated life record of President Trump, a lifetime of working closely with Jews, amicably and warmly, makes him someone whom Jews throughout the world appreciate deeply. Again — every survey and poll of Jews who actually live the Jewish observances, the kosher laws, the Sabbath, the Torah demonstrates that he is warmly regarded in that community.\n\nThe Fake News about Trump and Jews is the Rosetta Stone. Once one cracks that hidden code, everything else becomes clear. The Left Media indeed propound Fake News, lies, and falsehoods. They undertake to stoke anger among African Americans, among Latinos, among women. The People rely on them for the news, the truth — and, yes, for honest reporting when the President is wrong because The People benefit when they are told the truth, even when the truth is not pretty. But to depict him as an agent of Putin, as a man perpetrating treason, a hater?\n\nThese are the lies that come only from Enemies of the People.",

         "Last week , Creshuna Miles , Juror No . 8 in the Michael Dunn trial , gave an interview to CNN about the jury ’ s partial verdict . Although she believes that Michael Dunn is guilty of second-degree murder , a lesser charge for which the jury had the option to convict , she insisted that the case was “ not about race , ” that it never came up . Moreover , she believed Michael Dunn to be essentially “ a good guy , ” who made “ bad choices . ”\nStartlingly , she also indicated that until Dunn ran down the street chasing Jordan ’ s three friends , she actually believed that Dunn acted in self-defense .\nPost-racial thinking is insidious not only because it gives lie to the very real and continuing material consequences of racism in this country , but also because it seduces young , optimistic , idealistic black youth into identifying with the very systems and people who would kill them without a second thought -- and then go order a pizza and a take a nap .\nPart of what Miles ’ impressions of Dunn reveal is that the defense did a far better job of humanizing Dunn for the jury than the prosecution did of humanizing Jordan for the jury .\nBut her impressions also reveal a deep disidentification with the seemingly retrograde racial politics that informed Dunn ’ s fatal engagement with Jordan Davis . Those 20th century-style racial politics take as a given that a group of young black men listening to rap music must be up to no good and that white harm is imminent .\nSuch thinking seems not to fit the cosmopolitan , progressive 21st century narrative of multiracial acceptance that ideological post-racialism pretends to be .\nI know that jury selection is a strategy . And I know Creshuna Miles was picked because she is a black woman whose political views seem to be able to lay race to the side , even when it is so glaringly obvious .\nHad Jordan Davis been white , he would still be alive . Maybe Michael Dunn would have yelled at a white Jordan Davis for bumping rap music , but he absolutely would not have perceived such a kid to be a threat or the playing of rap music loud enough to constitute a capital offense .\nCreshuna Miles came to a right decision , and wanted to convict Michael Dunn of some form of murder . But her fervent belief that the case was “ about justice , ” not “ about race , ” misses a fundamental truth about American society . Justice and injustice in this country are inextricable from racial politics . Racial politics determine everything from who gets arrested to who gets convicted , the harshness of the sentences they ’ ll serve , and the quality of legal representation they ’ ll have .\nMoreover , Creshuna Miles is not just a black woman . She is a big , dark-skinned black woman , who rocks honey blond highlights in her hair . Her unmistakable , inescapable , culturally ethnic blackness is part of the unspoken but visual narrative of this trial . Just as Michael Dunn came upon a car and visually assessed threat based upon the color of the young men inside , the visuality of Creshuna Miles ’ body absolutely influences how her testimony is understood .\nIn some ways Miles is a perfect foil for Rachel Jeantel . In Jeantel ’ s post-Zimmerman trial interview , she discounted a juror who claimed race hadn ’ t mattered in the trial , telling Piers Morgan , “ Let ’ s be honest . It ’ s racial. ” In this case , Creshuna Miles , just one year older than and visually similar to Rachel , comes along and says just the opposite . In both cases , black America saw the bodies of these two women and cringed . Internalized self-hatred coupled with violent conditions for black men is always a dangerous brew for black women . So I have been less compelled to jump on the `` critique Creshuna '' bandwagon , because so much of it is rooted in the unreasonable expectations that we have for black women to know how to outwit a system that is designed to work against not just black men , but us , too . Still I see Rachel and Creshuna and a certain knowing emerges for me .\nI know that when you live your life in an unmistakably big black body , of the type that Rachel , Creshuna and I share , a body that is often seen as aggressive and threatening , two types of coping strategies emerge . One is a kind of aggressive embrace of one ’ s own blackness and a refusal to take any shit . That seems like how Rachel rolls . The other relies on a rejection of the truth about race as a form of triumph over the impenetrability of racial discourse . In other words , maybe Creshuna Miles felt more intelligent and progressive , by taking a contrarian position , by not holding the views that people assumed that she , as a black person , would hold .\nGiven her particular kind of black embodiment , Creshuna Miles ’ decision carries great weight in an American populace that deeply wants to believe in the myth of a colorblind system . The problem here – the lie of post-racialism , to be more precise – is that Miles ’ rejection of the racial elements of this case hold more weight precisely because she is a black woman . Essentially , finding the biggest and blackest of black women to say that there was no miscarriage of justice in this case helps assuage any white guilt .\nI ’ m not angry with Creshuna Miles . But I know her thinking , uninformed as it is , is dangerous . I know the justice system relies on the willing racial performativity of black people who are willing to discount the importance of race in matters such as these . Much like patriarchy requires the complicity and willing participation of women to continue , racism requires the complicity and willing , if unwitting , participation of black and people of color to continue .\nI ’ m deeply bothered by the fact that she does not seemingly understand the way in which her body was used against her . That she felt compelled as a black woman in the case to come out and insist on all the ways that it wasn ’ t about race suggests how deeply it is about race . Florida ’ s justice system pimped Creshuna Miles for her body type and flawed perspective . Her identification with Dunn is the flip side of the same kind of logic that got Trayvon and Jordan killed . She failed to recognize that she was on the jury and appealing to the media precisely because she reads as everything Dunn is not . She might see the justice system as colorblind , but it absolutely would not see her in the same ways . Everyone sees her color . By the same token , Trayvon , Jordan , Rachel and even Marcus Smart all believed they could engage white people who approached them combatively on equal or similar terms .\nWhen Zimmerman confronted and questioned Trayvon , Trayvon talked back and then fought back . When the Zimmerman defense team goaded Rachel Jeantel on the stand , she served up a healthy helping of visible disdain . When Michael Dunn confronted Jordan and his friends , they all verbally resisted his “ instruction ” and command that they turn down the music .\nThese young black folks have not fully reckoned with what it means to occupy a completely different social position than the white people who confronted them and demanded various forms of compliance . One set of social positions has legal protection and the right to armed self-defense . The other social position requires deference and the eschewing of all aggression in order to be believed and protected – and in order to stay among the living .\nJordan , Trayvon and Rachel never perfected the fine art of respectable resistance . And because I am deeply resistant to respectability politics on principle , I ’ m not sure they should . But the death and tragedy these young people have endured reminds me of why our ancestors frequently turned to respectable forms of resistance as a form of survival .\nWhen I look at Creshuna Miles , it is clear to me that her racial analysis is far more akin to that of her peers than different . All of these young people want to believe that they have the right to assert themselves and their rights and priorities in the same ways that white men retain the prerogative to do . Through the most brutal of lessons , they continue to learn differently .\nI hope Creshuna Miles learns differently . I remind myself that she is only 21 and that she did vote to convict . But racial innocence won ’ t serve her well . I hope she knows that she was chosen as a juror because of the combination of her black body and her whitewashed racial views , not despite them .

         "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on , though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question . So now , in order to preserve the broader framework — in which , for example , that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order , and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley .\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position , and the temporizing of others around her , I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done . There is still fierce opposition in some nearby quarters to what she has done , and she showed some degree of moral leadership when she called for state law to be quickly changed , so that the battle flag could be taken down . Yet , it ’ s equally clear that she has framed her argument well within the historical tradition of Southern white supremacist ideology — not in the heart of that tradition , to be sure , but still within the stifling folds of its garments .\nFor many people in our state the flag stands for traditions that are noble — traditions of history , of heritage , and of ancestry . The hate-filled murderer who massacred our brothers and sisters in Charleston has a sick and twisted view of the flag . In no way does he reflect the people in our state who respect and in many ways revere it . Those South Carolinians view the flag as a symbol of respect , integrity and duty . They also see it as a memorial , a way to honor ancestors who came to the service of their state during time of conflict . That is not hate . Nor is it racism .\nIn short , Dylann Roof messed things up for all the rest of us , so — unfortunately — things have to change . Implicitly , that ’ s the real bottom line . Haley continued , with a brief nod to the obvious , before hurrying on :\nAt the same time , for many others in South Carolina , the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past . As a state , we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints . We do not need to declare a winner and a loser here .\nAnd so she declared a truce — the truce of false equivalency — as the pathway forward :\nWe respect freedom of expression . And that for those who wish to show their respect for the flag on their private property , no one will stand in your way . But the statehouse is different . And the events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way .\nThe willingness to change is easy to grab onto and praise , but the more troubling aspects , the multiple ways in which change — not to mention simple justice — are more challenging to properly grasp , identify and name , much less come to terms with . At least three starting points can easily be identified , however . The first came from Ta-Nehisi Coates . Honing in on the underlying claim that Roof 's views did not reflect those of South Carolinians more broadly , Coates quickly weighed in to say :\nIf the governor meant that very few of the flag ’ s supporters believe in mass murder , she is surely right . But on the question of whose view of the Confederate Flag is more twisted , she is almost certainly wrong . Roof ’ s belief that black life had no purpose beyond subjugation is “ sick and twisted ” in the exact same manner as the beliefs of those who created the Confederate flag were “ sick and twisted. ” The Confederate flag is directly tied to the Confederate cause , and the Confederate cause was white supremacy .\nThis is the plain historical reality , and Coates goes on to rolls out stanza after stanza in an impressive historical litany of authoritative voices repeatedly underscoring the point , beginning with the Confederate states ’ own explanations for war , starting with South Carolina , then Mississippi ( which was particularly blunt : “ Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world. ” ) , Louisiana , Alabama ( “ the election of Mr. Lincoln can not be regarded otherwise than … an open declaration of war ” ) and Texas .\nHe then goes on to quote notable individuals , such as Jefferson Davis , not only affirming the centrality of slavery to the Southern cause , but elaborating on their desire to extend slaveholding into Cuba , Mexico and elsewhere , as well as propounding their belief that the equality of white men was founded on the slavery of blacks , and thus would be irrevocably lost if slavery were to be abolished . Thus , white supremacy for the South was not simply an isolated belief in the inherent superiority of whites as a race , it was the foundation for an aggressive and self-styled “ progressive ” worldview , a whole self-contained system of thought . The flag is inextricably linked to all of that .\nAs a second starting point it ’ s also true that the Confederate battle flag was largely a relic until it was revived in response to the Civil Rights Movement — first with Strom Thurmond ’ s “ States Rights Party ” in 1948 , then with Georgia adopting a version in protest of Brown v. Board of Education in 1956 , and South Carolina six years later — though , tellingly , the flag went up a year before the act authorizing it . For almost a hundred years , the South got on just fine celebrating its heritage without benefit of the flag . Indeed , the flag was raised over South Carolina as a result of the Civil War centennial celebration . This revival of interest in the flag was clearly all about renewed defiance of the federal government , which was finally being prodded into making good on the Civil War Amendments , and ensuring the full citizenship of African-Americans . Hence , today , the “ heritage ” the flag actually stands for is that of the 1960s , not the 1860s . Good luck with that .\nA third , related point , made by Jeet Heer at the New Republic , is that the flag matters tremendously as exertion of raw power . Its reintroduction in response to the Civil Rights movement sent a clear message : “ The feds might try to help you , but remember who is the boss down here . We still rule. ” Flying everywhere throughout the South , it sends the constant message to black Southerners , that they are not safe , they are not in control of their own personal security , much less anything else . Whatever other stories Southern whites might tell themselves and others about the flag , this basic fact remains . Indeed , the rhetorical act of denying the flag ’ s white supremacist meaning only demonstrates further how completely whites control things .\nBeyond these three starting points , there ’ s a vast terrain to explore , in terms of the white supremacist legacy the flag stands for and how it has reshaped itself over time . There are at least four key elements that any such account would have to explore . First , is the matter of white supremacy itself as a matter of organized social policy — both in terms of what it supports ( slavery in one era , segregation in the next , etc . ) and what it opposes ( abolition , integration , “ big government ” ) — as well as the culture it both depends upon and reproduces . Second , is the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to another , both establishing purportedly new foundations , while simultaneously reinterpreting the past .\nIt originally expressed itself in terms of slavery , then segregation and now largely in terms of what sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva described as “ colorblind racism ” in his book `` Racism Without Racists : Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America . '' Third , is the way in which white supremacy naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against . Bonilla-Silva ’ s book has a great deal to say about this as well . Furthermore , the pretense that the battle flag represents Civil War-era heritage rather than Civil Rights-era hatred is a telling example of how this process unfolds . Fourth , is the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance , etc . Haley leaned very heavily on this aspect of white supremacy in the process of pretending to reject it . So let us briefly consider each of these in turn .\nFirst , let ’ s reflect on white supremacy as a matter of organized social policy . There is nothing particularly difficult for people today to look back on past forms of white supremacy and reject them . It ’ s easy nowadays to see slavery or segregation as evil . Even Rand Paul , defending segregation in principle , said it was a bad business decision . But what about white supremacy policies today ?\nWhile part of the impetus to remove the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina came from respect for the Rev . Clementa Pinckney , the long-serving , highly respected member of the South Carolina State Senate , this only scratched the surface of Pinckney ’ s politics , as pointed out by North Carolina NAACP leader the Rev . William Barber on Democracy Now ! recently :\nReverend Pinckney , as a colleague in ministry , was not just opposed to the flag , he was opposed to the denial of Medicaid expansion , where now the majority of the state is opposing Medicaid expansion where six out of 10 black people live . He was opposed to voter suppression , voter ID in South Carolina . He was opposed to those who have celebrated the ending of the Voting Rights Act , or the gutting of Section 4 , which means South Carolina is no longer a preclearance state , and the very district that he served in is vulnerable right now . He was opposed to the lack of funding for public education . He wanted to see living wages raised .\nEvery item Barber mentioned is felt more deeply by the black community , so it ’ s not hard to grasp what a true rejection of white supremacy would look like . One might say that this calls for “ activist government , ” but the white South was all in favor of activist government `` When Affirmative Action Was White , '' as Ira Katznelson ’ s 2006 book explained . Thus , Barber continued :\nSo I would say to my colleagues , let ’ s take down the flag — to the governor — but also , let ’ s put together an omnibus bill in the name of the nine martyrs . And all of the things Reverend Pinckney was standing for , if we say we love him and his colleagues , let ’ s put all of those things in a one big omnibus bill and pass that and bring it to the funeral on Friday or Saturday , saying we will expand Medicaid to help not only black people , but poor white Southerners in South Carolina , because it ’ s not just the flag . Lee Atwater talked about the Southern strategy , where policy was used as a way to divide us . And if we want harmony , we have to talk about racism , not just in terms of symbol , but in the substance of policies . The flag went up to fight policies . If we ’ re going to bring it down , we ’ re also going to have to change policies , and particularly policies that create disparate impact on black , brown and poor white people .\nThe phrase “ disparate impact , ” which Barber used , is key to how white supremacy operates in the post-segregation era . It ’ s not that the races are treated entirely differently , only that the odds , burdens , privileges and benefits change , depending on the color of your skin . Often this happens without any conscious awareness , which is why Bonilla-Silva ’ s phrase , “ racism without racists ” is so apt . This is really not difficult to grasp — unless you ’ ve got a vested interest in not grasping it . In which case , welcome to the world of our second topic , the way in which white supremacy reorganizes itself from one historical regime to the next , and how\nTransitions between eras are often abrupt in some respects — the swift abolition of slavery in the final years of the Civil War , for example — while taking decades to work out in other ways . In order to first establish , and then fully stabilize the segregationist era , the meaning and purpose of the Civil War itself had to be reinterpreted through a white supremacist lens . The story of how that transpired over a fifty-year period is the subject of `` Race and Reunion : The Civil War in American Memory '' by David W. Blight . As I summarized in my review :\nBlight explains three broad visions of Civil War memory - reconciliationist , emancipationist and white supremacist . The first was born in wartime responses to its terrible brutality , epitomized by Walt Whitman 's experience of tending the wounded and dying of both sides . The second sprang not just from the war , but also from the Emancipation Proclamation and the more than 200,000 black combatants who joined the fight . The third gradually reformulated itself after the shock of military defeat , eventually dominating reconciliationist thinking by sacrificing racial reconciliation for the sake of sectional reunion .\nIt was not surprising that the reconciliationist view came to dominate — politically , materially , the nation needed sectional reintegration in a much more immediate way than it needed anything for its black citizens — a calculus that would eventually change over time . What ’ s striking is the relative ease with which the white supremacist vision came to merge with and dominate the reconciliationist view .\nThis is not the exception , but the rule in American history : any moves toward reconciling differences inevitably become infected with white supremacist aims — unless , of course , they are founded on them to begin with , as the case with American Colonization Society and the movement surrounding it , more on that below . A similar process has taken place with the end of segregation and the discrediting of overt racism which the norm in that era throughout the South , as well as in much of the North . This is essence of what Bonilla-Silva reveals in `` Racism Without Racists '' : a set of beliefs has emerged with superficially broad appeal , but which harbors a “ hidden ” white supremacist impact . Bonilla-Silva identifies four central frames at the core of colorblind racism : `` The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information , '' Bonilla-Silva writes . The first — and what I take to be the most significant and distinctive frame — is “ abstract liberalism , ” which he explains as follows :\nThe frame of abstract liberalism involves using ideas associated with political liberalism ( e.g . `` equal opportunity , '' the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy ) and economic liberalism ( e.g. , choice , individualism ) in an abstract manner to explain racial matters .\nWhat abstract liberalism hides is virtually everything having to do with history and indeed all social science , outside the narrow framework of market economics . It hides all historical inequalities , which recent research suggests persists for as long as ten generations . It also hides subconscious racial preferences , which can create intense segregation without any overt centralized coercion . But above all , it creates the illusion of some idealized social order , which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “ reverse racism. ” In short , the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them : they are the “ real racists , ” not whites !\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles , but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone . These are “ naturalization , ” which “ allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences , ” “ cultural racism ” which “ relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘ Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education ’ or ‘ blacks have too many babies ’ to explain the standing of minorities in society ” and “ minimization of racism ” which “ suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities ' life chances ( ‘ It 's better now than in the past ’ or ‘ There is discrimination , but there are plenty of jobs out there ’ ) . ” All three of these frames have been used in past eras . For example , Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past , so segregation was something blacks could and should accept . Similarly , cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism . But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today .\nAs I indicated above , not only does Bonilla-Silva ’ s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another , it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “ naturalizes , normalizes and moralizes itself , so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify , much less name , and fight against. ” Indeed , this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “ common sense ” emerges , responding to multiple different needs at once , most typically , a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible , and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible . The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude , even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact . Meanwhile , those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order , even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics .\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic , the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals , such bringing people together , establishing peace and harmony , promoting tolerance and so forth . It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else , and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done . Not only does white supremacy lay down the law , if conflicts arise in response , white supremacy takes the lead in naming , identifying and analyzing them , leading to proposed white supremacist solutions . On a macro scale , this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale , from the lowliest parts on up to the whole .\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society . It was originally founded to bring together two politically disparate groups , Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders , both united by the belief that free blacks faced a miserable future in America , and would be better off in Africa . This granddaddy of all “ grand bargains ” was laughable on its face — there hundreds of thousands of free blacks , far more than could ever be returned to Africa , even if they had all wanted to go — which most emphatically did not . But it was extremely popular with political elites , precisely because of its centrist power to “ bring people together ” — white people , that is . In his book , `` Of One Blood : Abolitionism and the Origins of Racial Equality , '' historian Paul Goodman had this to say :\nBy 1817 , African colonization had become more than a speculative idea . In the next decade , hundreds of prominent Americans -- political leaders including Presidents Madison and Monroe and religious leaders in most of the large denominations , from Presbyterian Lyman Beecher of Massachusetts to Episcopalian bishop William Mead of Virginia—threw their prestige and influence behind the America Colonization Society ( ACS ) , which established the colony of Liberia in West Africa . One of the most impressive voluntary societies of its day , the ACS boasted over two hundred state and local auxiliaries by 1830 . It was quietly assisted by President Monroe and endorsed by state legislatures and the major religious denominations , as well as by an illustrious panoply of notables .\nAs Goodman goes on to describe , the 19th-Century abolitionist movement was born out of free blacks ’ opposition to the ACS . It was precisely their unwillingness to be “ reasonable ” which formed the foundation of resistance which eventually spread to white abolitionists , and over a period five decades , eventually resulted in emancipation . Yet , almost up until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation he himself continued to be a supporter of colonization — such was the power of this “ centrist ” white supremacist vision . In fact , the ACS lived on for almost 100 years after Lincoln ’ s death — it only shut down in 1964 !\nThere are many other instances in which the cause of black freedom only advanced by refusing to be “ reasonable ” or to live up to some purported virtue or another . That ’ s because white supremacy , in one form or another , has always had such an enormous say in dictating what it meant to be “ reasonable ” or virtuous . And so it ’ s been incumbent on blacks to learn to think outside the box — to find a broader framework of understanding on which to found their moral as well as their political analysis .\nThis is why Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , once spoke to the American Psychological Association , and came out proudly for the cause of what he called “ creative maladjustment ” :\nI am sure that we will recognize that there are some things in our society , some things in our world , to which we should never be adjusted . There are some things concerning which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will . We must never adjust ourselves to racial discrimination and racial segregation . We must never adjust ourselves to religious bigotry . We must never adjust ourselves to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few . We must never adjust ourselves to the madness of militarism , and the self-defeating effects of physical violence… . Thus , it may well be that our world is in dire need of a new organization , The International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment .\nSimilarly , King ’ s “ Letter From Birmingham Jail ” was all about rejecting the framework of passive , superficial words of peace , moderation and restraint which the white ministers of Birmingham sought to impose on him . Here is just a small section of the wisdom it contains :\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress . I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace , in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight , to a substantive and positive peace , in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality . Actually , we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension . We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive . We bring it out in the open , where it can be seen and dealt with .\nI could not help myself thinking about the profound wrong-headed of “ reasonable ” white supremacy as I heard Nikki Haley ’ s speech , which is why my enthusiasm for it was so dimmed . In perhaps her most deeply typical move , she said there didn ’ t have to be winners and losers . Folks who love the flag and folks who despise it can all get along just fine ! But , of course , that leaves the entire substantive agenda Reverend Barber spoke about dead on arrival — just as it was supposed to do . There is no real underlying intent to address and disown the evil of white supremacy . The only way that evil is faced is by projecting it onto the disowned Confederate son , Dylann Roof .\nA good way to understand what ’ s wrong with Haley ’ s speech is to compare it with a speech by a quintessential white Southerner , Strom Thurmond ’ s son , whose speech makes no such attempt to defend the blind worship of “ heritage. ” Here is what South Carolina State Senator Paul Thurmond said :\nI am aware of my heritage . But my appreciation for the things that my forebearers accomplished to make my life better doesn ’ t mean that I must believe that they always made the right decisions and , for the life of me , I will never understand how anyone could fight a civil war based , in part , on the desire to continue the practice of slavery . Think about it for just a second . Our ancestors were literally fighting to continue to keep human beings as slaves and continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will . I am not proud of this heritage . These practices were inhumane and were wrong , wrong , wrong .\nWhere Haley felt the need to comfort — even identify with — those who see the flag as a symbol of noble heritage , Paul Thurmond simply said , “ I am not proud. ” Simple as that . A clean break . And that , my friends , is what America needs , where white supremacy is concerned . A clean break — and then the real business of a creating a livable future for all of us can begin .",
         "One particular constellation of white supremacist assumptions — centered on, though not limited to the state-sanctioned display of the Confederate battle flag — has suddenly fallen into question. So now, in order to preserve the broader framework — in which, for example, that symbol of white supremacy can be proudly preserved for private and non-state public display — a slight reorientation is in order, and was recently articulated by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.\n\nGiven how sharply Haley broke with her previous position, and the temporizing of others around her, I do not wish to sound ungrateful or unappreciative of what she has done.

Yet, it’s equally clear that she has framed her argument well within the historical tradition of Southern white supremacist ideology — not in the heart of that tradition, to be sure, but still within the stifling folds of its garments.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHere's Haley:\n\nFor many people in our state the flag stands for traditions that are noble — traditions of history, of heritage, and of ancestry. The hate-filled murderer who massacred our brothers and sisters in Charleston has a sick and twisted view of the flag. In no way does he reflect the people in our state who respect and in many ways revere it. Those South Carolinians view the flag as a symbol of respect, integrity and duty. They also see it as a memorial, a way to honor ancestors who came to the service of their state during time of conflict. That is not hate. Nor is it racism.\n\nIn short, Dylann Roof messed things up for all the rest of us, so — unfortunately — things have to change. Implicitly, that’s the real bottom line. Haley continued, with a brief nod to the obvious, before hurrying on:\n\nAt the same time, for many others in South Carolina, the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past. As a state, we can survive and indeed we can thrive as we have done whilst still being home to both of those viewpoints.

The third gradually reformulated itself after the shock of military defeat, eventually dominating reconciliationist thinking by sacrificing racial reconciliation for the sake of sectional reunion.\n\nIt was not surprising that the reconciliationist view came to dominate — politically, materially, the nation needed sectional reintegration in a much more immediate way than it needed anything for its black citizens — a calculus that would eventually change over time. What’s striking is the relative ease with which the white supremacist vision came to merge with and dominate the reconciliationist view.\n\nThis is not the exception, but the rule in American history: any moves toward reconciling differences inevitably become infected with white supremacist aims — unless, of course, they are founded on them to begin with, as the case with American Colonization Society and the movement surrounding it, more on that below. A similar process has taken place with the end of segregation and the discrediting of overt racism which the norm in that era throughout the South, as well as in much of the North. This is essence of what Bonilla-Silva reveals in \"Racism Without Racists\": a set of beliefs has emerged with superficially broad appeal, but which harbors a “hidden” white supremacist impact. Bonilla-Silva identifies four central frames at the core of colorblind racism: \"The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information,\" Bonilla-Silva writes. The first — and what I take to be the most significant and distinctive frame — is “abstract liberalism,” which he explains as follows:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe frame of abstract liberalism involves using ideas associated with political liberalism (e.g. \"equal opportunity,\" the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy) and economic liberalism (e.g., choice, individualism) in an abstract manner to explain racial matters.\n\nWhat abstract liberalism hides is virtually everything having to do with history and indeed all social science, outside the narrow framework of market economics. It hides all historical inequalities, which recent research suggests persists for as long as ten generations. It also hides subconscious racial preferences, which can create intense segregation without any overt centralized coercion. But above all, it creates the illusion of some idealized social order, which blacks objecting to can be portrayed as opposing in favor of racial preferences — aka “reverse racism.” In short, the moral burden of racism past can be shifted onto them: they are the “real racists,” not whites!\n\nThe three other frames Bonilla-Silva identifies also play significant roles, but I would argue they are less specifically tied to this era alone. These are “naturalization,” which “allows whites to explain away racial phenomena by suggesting they are natural occurrences,” “cultural racism” which “relies on culturally based arguments such as ‘Mexicans do not put much emphasis on education’ or ‘blacks have too many babies’ to explain the standing of minorities in society” and “minimization of racism” which “suggests discrimination is no longer a central factor affecting minorities' life chances (‘It's better now than in the past’ or ‘There is discrimination, but there are plenty of jobs out there’).” All three of these frames have been used in past eras. For example, Booker T. Washington was a celebrated black figure precisely because he argued so powerfully that things were better than in the past, so segregation was something blacks could and should accept. Similarly, cultural racism was always part of the package in older forms of racism. But I believe Bonilla-Silva is essentially correct in identifying these a surviving frameworks as playing central roles in how racism functions in America today.\n\nAs I indicated above, not only does Bonilla-Silva’s concept of colorblind racism illuminate how white supremacy has transitioned from one formulation to another, it also shows how this new form of white supremacy “naturalizes, normalizes and moralizes itself, so as to render itself difficult to clearly identify, much less name, and fight against.” Indeed, this is the very essence of how one framework of white supremacy comes to replace another — a new framework of “common sense” emerges, responding to multiple different needs at once, most typically, a need to reject and distance society from older practices that have become indefensible, and a contrary need to retain as much of the underlying power relations as possible. The rejection of the old order may can even serve to infuse the new order with a presumption of moral rectitude, even as it maintains many of the features of the old order virtually intact. Meanwhile, those who might object can be cast as moral outsiders — even holdovers of the old order, even if they are among its most profound and strenuous critics.\n\nThis leads us directly to our fourth topic, the way in which white supremacy usurps otherwise noble ideals, such bringing people together, establishing peace and harmony, promoting tolerance and so forth. It is the very nature of social power that those with the most of it can use their power to define social reality for everybody else, and this is what white supremacist ideology has repeatedly done. Not only does white supremacy lay down the law, if conflicts arise in response, white supremacy takes the lead in naming, identifying and analyzing them, leading to proposed white supremacist solutions. On a macro scale, this is how one form of white supremacist society comes to be replaced by another — but it applies on every scale, from the lowliest parts on up to the whole.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOne significant example of this can be found in the history of the American Colonization Society. It was originally founded to bring together two politically disparate groups, Northern abolitionists and Southern slaveholders, both united by the belief that free blacks faced a miserable future in America, and would be better off in Africa. This granddaddy of all “grand bargains” was laughable on its face — there hundreds of thousands of free blacks, far more than could ever be returned to Africa, even if they had all wanted to go — which most emphatically did not. But it was extremely popular with political elites, precisely because of its centrist power to “bring people together” — white people, that is. In his book, \"Of One Blood: Abolitionism and the Origins of Racial Equality,\" historian Paul Goodman had this to say:\n\nBy 1817, African colonization had become more than a speculative idea. In the next decade, hundreds of prominent Americans--political leaders including Presidents Madison and Monroe and religious leaders in most of the large denominations, from Presbyterian Lyman Beecher of Massachusetts to Episcopalian bishop William Mead of Virginia—threw their prestige and influence behind the America Colonization Society (ACS), which established the colony of Liberia in West Africa. One of the most impressive voluntary societies of its day, the ACS boasted over two hundred state and local auxiliaries by 1830. It was quietly assisted by President Monroe and endorsed by state legislatures and the major religious denominations, as well as by an illustrious panoply of notables.\n\nAs Goodman goes on to describe, the 19th-Century abolitionist movement was born out of free blacks’ opposition to the ACS. It was precisely their unwillingness to be “reasonable” which formed the foundation of resistance which eventually spread to white abolitionists, and over a period five decades, eventually resulted in emancipation. Yet, almost up until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation he himself continued to be a supporter of colonization — such was the power of this “centrist” white supremacist vision. In fact, the ACS lived on for almost 100 years after Lincoln’s death — it only shut down in 1964!\n\nThere are many other instances in which the cause of black freedom only advanced by refusing to be “reasonable” or to live up to some purported virtue or another. That’s because white supremacy, in one form or another, has always had such an enormous say in dictating what it meant to be “reasonable” or virtuous. And so it’s been incumbent on blacks to learn to think outside the box — to find a broader framework of understanding on which to found their moral as well as their political analysis.\n\nThis is why Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once spoke to the American Psychological Association, and came out proudly for the cause of what he called “creative maladjustment”:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI am sure that we will recognize that there are some things in our society, some things in our world, to which we should never be adjusted. There are some things concerning which we must always be maladjusted if we are to be people of good will. We must never adjust ourselves to racial discrimination and racial segregation. We must never adjust ourselves to religious bigotry. We must never adjust ourselves to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. We must never adjust ourselves to the madness of militarism, and the self-defeating effects of physical violence…. Thus, it may well be that our world is in dire need of a new organization, The International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment.\n\nSimilarly, King’s “Letter From Birmingham Jail” was all about rejecting the framework of passive, superficial words of peace, moderation and restraint which the white ministers of Birmingham sought to impose on him. Here is just a small section of the wisdom it contains:\n\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with.\n\nI could not help myself thinking about the profound wrong-headed of “reasonable” white supremacy as I heard Nikki Haley’s speech, which is why my enthusiasm for it was so dimmed. In perhaps her most deeply typical move, she said there didn’t have to be winners and losers. Folks who love the flag and folks who despise it can all get along just fine! But, of course, that leaves the entire substantive agenda Reverend Barber spoke about dead on arrival — just as it was supposed to do. There is no real underlying intent to address and disown the evil of white supremacy. The only way that evil is faced is by projecting it onto the disowned Confederate son, Dylann Roof.\n\nA good way to understand what’s wrong with Haley’s speech is to compare it with a speech by a quintessential white Southerner, Strom Thurmond’s son, whose speech makes no such attempt to defend the blind worship of “heritage.” Here is what South Carolina State Senator Paul Thurmond said:\n\nI am aware of my heritage. But my appreciation for the things that my forebearers accomplished to make my life better doesn’t mean that I must believe that they always made the right decisions and, for the life of me, I will never understand how anyone could fight a civil war based, in part, on the desire to continue the practice of slavery. Think about it for just a second. Our ancestors were literally fighting to continue to keep human beings as slaves and continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will. I am not proud of this heritage. These practices were inhumane and were wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\nWhere Haley felt the need to comfort — even identify with — those who see the flag as a symbol of noble heritage, Paul Thurmond simply said, “I am not proud.” Simple as that. A clean break. And that, my friends, is what America needs, where white supremacy is concerned. A clean break — and then the real business of a creating a livable future for all of us can begin.",

         "Chinese tech giants Tencent Holdings TCEHY, Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd BABA, and ByteDance have significantly increased orders for Nvidia Corporation's NVDA H20 AI chips, as the rise of DeepSeek's low-cost AI models drives a surge in demand for AI computing power.\nWhat Happened: The spike in H20 chip orders, reported by Reuters, citing six people familiar with the matter, highlights Nvidia's continued dominance in the AI chip market.\nThe H20 is a China-specific chip, developed in response to U.S. export restrictions that prevent Nvidia from selling its most advanced AI hardware to Chinese companies.\nWhile concerns about additional U.S. trade restrictions exist, sources say the primary driver behind the demand is DeepSeek's AI models, which optimize computational efficiency for inference tasks rather than relying solely on raw processing power.\nSee Also: Google Sued Over AI Search Overviews — Education Company Says Tech Giant Is Stealing Content And Driving Publishers Out Of Business\nThese models have gained rapid adoption across industries, from cloud computing to automotive applications.\nTencent is reportedly testing DeepSeek's AI models in WeChat, while automaker Great Wall has integrated them into its connected vehicle systems. Analysts estimate Nvidia shipped around 1 million H20 chips in 2024, generating over $12 billion in revenue.\nWhy It Matters: Last month, Nvidia recognized China's DeepSeek R1 AI model. The model built for less than $6 million, allegedly outperformed top U.S. models, including those from OpenAI.\nThis milestone contributed to a broader tech market downturn, leading to a 17% decline in Nvidia's stock and a more than 20% plunge in AI infrastructure shares. It also led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia's market capitalization.\nEarlier this month, in an interview, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed investor concerns, attributing the sell-off to misconceptions about AI infrastructure spending.\nPrice Action: In after-hours trading, Nvidia rose 0.51%, reaching $130.95 at the time of publication, according to Benzinga Pro.\nImage via Shutterstock\nRead Next:\nElon Musk’s $97.4 Billion OpenAI Takeover Bid Reportedly Not Received By ChatGPT Parent: ‘Another One Of His Tactics,’ Says Sam Altman",

         "By Fanny Potkin and Che Pan\nSINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese companies are ramping up orders for Nvidia (NASDAQ:)'s H20 artificial intelligence chip due to booming demand for DeepSeek's low-cost AI models, six people familiar with the matter said.\nThe surge in orders, which is being reported for the first time by Reuters, underlines Nvidia's dominance of the market and could help alleviate concerns that DeepSeek might cause a slide in AI chip demand.\nTencent, Alibaba (NYSE:) and ByteDance have \"significantly increased\" orders of the H20 - a chip specific to China due to U.S. export controls - since the Chinese AI startup burst into the global public consciousness last month, two of the people said.\nIn addition to their internal needs for advanced AI chips, the three tech giants provide cloud computing services through which other firms can access and use AI tools.\nSmaller companies in sectors like healthcare and education are also purchasing AI servers equipped with DeepSeek models and Nvidia H20 chips, said a source at one of China's largest server makers. Previously only deep-pocketed financial and telecoms firms bought servers with AI computing systems, the source added.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's administration is looking at imposing restrictions on the sale of the H20 chip to China, Reuters has reported. While the threat of further controls could be a factor in the jump in orders, the sources cited DeepSeek as the reason.\nThe sources did not provide details on the size of the orders. They were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.\nNvidia did not respond to queries on how much demand for the H20 it was seeing from China but said its products won \"on merit in a competitive field\". The company is set to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday.\nTencent, ByteDance and Alibaba did not respond to requests for comment.\nDeepSeek's large language models rival Western systems in performance at a fraction of the cost as they focus on \"inference\" or producing conclusions. That optimises computational efficiency rather than relying solely on raw processing power.\n\"When DeepSeek launched, many misjudged that computing power demand might stagnate or decrease. In reality, more advanced AI models drive deeper integration into daily life, exponentially increasing inference-level compute need,\" said Nori Chiou, investment director at Singapore-based White Oak Capital Partners (WA:).\nA DeepSeek-induced global rout in AI stocks that began January 24 saw Nvidia shares lose as much as a fifth of their value at one point but they have since regained most of that ground and are down just 3% for the year to date.\nThough wider deployment of DeepSeek AI models is expected to help Chinese chipmakers such as Huawei better compete in the domestic market thanks to the models' focus on inference, Nvidia's H20 chip remains the industry standard in China.\nAnalysts estimate Nvidia shipped approximately 1 million H20 units in 2024, generating over $12 billion in revenue for the company.\nThe H20 is the primary chip Nvidia is legally permitted to sell in China and was launched after the latest round of U.S. export restrictions took effect in October 2023. Washington has banned exports of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China since 2022, concerned that advanced technologies could be used by China to build up its military capabilities.\nNumerous Chinese companies have announced plans to use DeepSeek's models. Among them are Tencent, which has said it will beta test integrating the models into its highly popular WeChat messaging app, and automaker Great Wall which has integrated DeepSeek's model into its connected vehicle system.",

         "Deepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics.\nThe company says it hopes the new model will produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. Details of the accelerated timeline for R2’s release have not been previously reported.\nDeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nRivals are still digesting the implications of R1, which was built with less-powerful Nvidia chips but is competitive with those developed at the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars by U.S. tech giants.\n“The launch of DeepSeek’s R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry,” said Vijayasimha Alilughatta, chief operating officer of Indian tech services provider Zensar. DeepSeek’s success at creating cost-effective AI models “would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts … breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field,” he said.\nR2 is likely to worry the U.S. government, which has identified leadership of AI as a national priority. Its release may further galvanize Chinese authorities and companies, dozens of which say they have started integrating DeepSeek models into their products.\nLittle is known about DeepSeek, whose founder Liang Wenfeng became a billionaire through his quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang, who was described by a former employer as “low-key and introverted,” has not spoken to any media since July 2024.\nReuters interviewed a dozen former employees, as well as quant fund professionals knowledgeable about the operations of DeepSeek and its parent company High-Flyer. It also reviewed state media articles, social-media posts from the companies and research papers dating back to 2019.\nThey told a story of a company that functioned more like a research lab than a for-profit enterprise and was unencumbered by the hierarchical traditions of China’s high-pressure tech industry, even as it became responsible for what many investors see as the latest breakthrough in AI.\nDIFFERENT PATH\nLiang was born in 1985 in a rural village in the southern province of Guangdong. He later obtained communication engineering degrees at the elite Zhejiang University.\nOne of his first jobs was running a research department at a smart imaging firm in Shanghai. His then-boss, Zhou Chaoen, told state media on Feb. 9 that Liang had hired prize-winning algorithm engineers and operated with a “flat management style.”\nAt DeepSeek and High-Flyer, Liang has similarly shunned the practices of Chinese tech giants known for rigid top-down management, low pay for young employees and “996” – working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.\nLiang opened his Beijing office within walking distance of Tsinghua University and Peking University, China’s two most prestigious education institutions. He regularly delved into technical details and was happy to work alongside Gen-Z interns and recent graduates that comprised the bulk of its workforce, according to two former employees.

         "By Eduardo Baptista, Julie Zhu and Fanny Potkin\nBEIJING/HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - DeepSeek is looking to press home its advantage.\nThe Chinese startup triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month with a cut-price AI reasoning model that outperformed many Western competitors.\nNow, the Hangzhou-based firm is accelerating the launch of the successor to January's R1 model, according to three people familiar with the company.\nDeepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics.\nThe company says it hopes the new model will produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. Details of the accelerated timeline for R2's release have not been previously reported.\nDeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nRivals are still digesting the implications of R1, which was built with less-powerful Nvidia chips but is competitive with those developed at the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars by U.S. tech giants.\n\"The launch of DeepSeek's R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry,\" said Vijayasimha Alilughatta, chief operating officer of Indian tech services provider Zensar. DeepSeek's success at creating cost-effective AI models \"would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts ... breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field,\" he said.\nSPONSORED\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\n1. Finding a fiduciary financial advisor can be simple. Datalign Advisory offers a free tool that matches you with a financial advisor in your area in just 3 minutes.\n2. Datalign Advisory’s platform only includes advisors registered with the SEC who are dedicated to the fiduciary standard, meaning they must act in your best interests. Get started today!\nR2 is likely to worry the U.S. government, which has identified leadership of AI as a national priority. Its release may further galvanize Chinese authorities and companies, dozens of which say they have started integrating DeepSeek models into their products.\nLittle is known about DeepSeek, whose founder Liang Wenfeng became a billionaire through his quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang, who was described by a former employer as \"low-key and introverted,\" has not spoken to any media since July 2024.\nReuters interviewed a dozen former employees, as well as quant fund professionals knowledgeable about the operations of DeepSeek and its parent company High-Flyer. It also reviewed state media articles, social-media posts from the companies and research papers dating back to 2019.\nThey told a story of a company that functioned more like a research lab than a for-profit enterprise and was unencumbered by the hierarchical traditions of China's high-pressure tech industry, even as it became responsible for what many investors see as the latest breakthrough in AI.\nDIFFERENT PATH\nLiang was born in 1985 in a rural village in the southern province of Guangdong. He later obtained communication engineering degrees at the elite Zhejiang University.\nOne of his first jobs was running a research department at a smart imaging firm in Shanghai. His then-boss, Zhou Chaoen, told state media on Feb. 9 that Liang had hired prize-winning algorithm engineers and operated with a \"flat management style.\"\nAt DeepSeek and High-Flyer, Liang has similarly shunned the practices of Chinese tech giants known for rigid top-down management, low pay for young employees and \"996\" - working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.\nLiang opened his Beijing office within walking distance of Tsinghua University and Peking University, China's two most prestigious education institutions. He regularly delved into technical details and was happy to work alongside Gen-Z interns and recent graduates that comprised the bulk of its workforce, according to two former employees.

         "By Eduardo Baptista, Julie Zhu and Fanny Potkin\nBEIJING/HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - DeepSeek is looking to press home its advantage.\nThe Chinese startup triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month with a cut-price AI reasoning model that outperformed many Western competitors.\nNow, the Hangzhou-based firm is accelerating the launch of the successor to January's R1 model, according to three people familiar with the company.\nDeepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics.\nThe company says it hopes the new model will produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. Details of the accelerated timeline for R2's release have not been previously reported.\nDeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nRivals are still digesting the implications of R1, which was built with less-powerful Nvidia (NASDAQ:) chips but is competitive with those developed at the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars by U.S. tech giants.\n\"The launch of DeepSeek's R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry,\" said Vijayasimha Alilughatta, chief operating officer of Indian tech services provider Zensar. DeepSeek's success at creating cost-effective AI models \"would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts ... breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field,\" he said.\nR2 is likely to worry the U.S. government, which has identified leadership of AI as a national priority. Its release may further galvanize Chinese authorities and companies, dozens of which say they have started integrating DeepSeek models into their products.\nLittle is known about DeepSeek, whose founder Liang Wenfeng became a billionaire through his quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang, who was described by a former employer as \"low-key and introverted,\" has not spoken to any media since July 2024.\nReuters interviewed a dozen former employees, as well as quant fund professionals knowledgeable about the operations of DeepSeek and its parent company High-Flyer. It also reviewed state media articles, social-media posts from the companies and research papers dating back to 2019.\nThey told a story of a company that functioned more like a research lab than a for-profit enterprise and was unencumbered by the hierarchical traditions of China's high-pressure tech industry, even as it became responsible for what many investors see as the latest breakthrough in AI.\nDIFFERENT PATH\nLiang was born in 1985 in a rural village in the southern province of Guangdong. He later obtained communication engineering degrees at the elite Zhejiang University.\nOne of his first jobs was running a research department at a smart imaging firm in Shanghai. His then-boss, Zhou Chaoen, told state media on Feb. 9 that Liang had hired prize-winning algorithm engineers and operated with a \"flat management style.\"\nAt DeepSeek and High-Flyer, Liang has similarly shunned the practices of Chinese tech giants known for rigid top-down management, low pay for young employees and \"996\" - working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.\nLiang opened his Beijing office within walking distance of Tsinghua University and Peking University, China's two most prestigious education institutions. He regularly delved into technical details and was happy to work alongside Gen-Z interns and recent graduates that comprised the bulk of its workforce, according to two former employees. They also described usually working eight-hour days in a collaborative atmosphere.\n\"Liang gave us control and treated us as experts. He constantly asked questions and learned alongside us,\" said 26-year-old researcher Benjamin Liu, who left the company in September. \"DeepSeek allowed me to take ownership of critical parts of the pipeline, which was very exciting.\"\nLiang did not respond to questions sent via DeepSeek.\nWhile Baidu (NASDAQ:) and other Chinese tech giants were racing to build their consumer-facing versions of ChatGPT in 2023 and profit off of the global AI boom, Liang told Chinese media outlet Waves last year that he deliberately avoided spending heavily on app development, focusing instead on refining the AI model's quality.\nBoth DeepSeek and High-Flyer are known for paying generously, according to three people familiar with its compensation practices. At High-Flyer, it is not uncommon for a senior data scientist to make 1.5 million yuan annually, while competitors rarely pay more than 800,000, said one of the people, a rival quant fund manager who knows Liang.\nThe largesse was funded by High-Flyer, which became one of China's most successful quant funds and, even after a government crackdown on the sector, still manages tens of billions of yuan, according to two people in the industry.\nCOMPUTING POWER\nDeepSeek's success with a low-cost AI model is based on High-Flyer's decade-long and substantial investment in research and computing power, three people said.\nThe quant fund was an earlier pioneer in AI trading and a top executive said in 2020 that High-Flyer was going \"all in\" on AI by re-investing 70% of its revenue, mostly into AI research.\nHigh-Flyer spent 1.2 billion yuan on two supercomputing AI clusters in 2020 and 2021. The second cluster, Fire-Flyer II, was made up of around 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, used for training AI models.\nDeepSeek had not been established at that time, so the accumulation of computing power caught the attention of Chinese securities regulators, said a person with direct knowledge of officials' thinking.\n\"Regulators wanted to know why they need so many chips?\" the person said. \"How they were going to use it? What kind of impact would that have on the market?\"\nAuthorities decided not to intervene, in a move that would prove crucial for DeepSeek's fortunes: the U.S. banned the export of A100 chips to China in 2022, at which point Fire-Flyer II was already in operation.\nBeijing now celebrates DeepSeek, but has instructed it not to engage with the media without approval, according to a person familiar with Chinese official thinking.\nAuthorities had asked Liang to keep a low-profile because they were worried that too much hype in the media would draw unnecessary attention, the person said.\nChina's cabinet and commerce ministry, as well as China's securities regulator, did not respond to requests for comment.\nAs one of the few companies with a large A100 cluster, High-Flyer and DeepSeek were able to attract some of China's best research talent, two former employees said.\n\"The key advantage of vast (computing) resources is that it allows for large-scale experimentation,\" said Liu, the former employee.\nSome Western AI entrepreneurs, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, have claimed that DeepSeek had as many as 50,000 higher-end Nvidia chips that are banned for export to China. He has not produced evidence for the allegation or responded to Reuters' requests to provide proof.\nDeepSeek has not responded to Wang's claims. Two former employees attributed the company's success to Liang's focus on more cost-effective AI architecture.\nThe startup used techniques like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and multihead latent attention (MLA), which incur far lower computing costs, its research papers show.\nThe MoE technique divides an AI model into different areas of expertise and activates only those related to a query, as opposed to more common architectures that use the entire model.\nMLA architecture allows a model to process different aspects of one piece of information simultaneously, helping it detect key details more effectively.\nWhile competitors like France's Mistral have developed models based on MoE, DeepSeek was the first firm to depend heavily on this architecture while achieving parity with more expensively built models.\nDeepSeek's pricing was 20 to 40 times cheaper than what OpenAI charged for equivalent models, analysts at Bernstein brokerage estimated in early February.\nFor now, Western and Chinese tech giants have signaled plans to continue heavy AI spending, but DeepSeek's success with R1 and its earlier V3 model has prompted some to alter strategies.\nOpenAI cut prices this month, while Google (NASDAQ:)'s Gemini has introduced discounted tiers of access. Since R1's launch, OpenAI has also released an O3-Mini model that relies on less computing power.\nAdnan Masood of U.S. tech services provider UST told Reuters that his laboratory had run benchmarks that found R1 often used three times as many tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, for reasoning as OpenAI's scaled-down model.\nSTATE EMBRACE\nEven before R1 gripped global attention, there were signs that DeepSeek had caught Beijing's favor.

However, the sources didn’t provide a new release date for DeepSeek-R2, which has yet to be announced.\nWe don’t know much about DeepSeek’s next AI model yet, but the Chinese company wants R2 to have improved coding skills and reason in languages other than English.\nWhen DeepSeek-R1 launched, the entire industry was taken aback by the research paper that claimed the highly sophisticated model was trained at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s o1. The pushback was immediate, though, as OpenAI posited that DeepSeek distilled ChatGPT to train its model, and Google called DeepSeek’s claims “exaggerated.”\nNevertheless, many companies were quick to adopt the new model, including OpenAI investor Microsoft, which added DeepSeek-R1 to Azure AI Foundry and GitHub.

         "India's AI mission proposes subsidising chips for application and product development, but Vardhan has advocated for allocating funds to build foundational technology as well. LLMs, focussed on text-based tasks, can be seen as a subset of foundation models, which a broader set of general-purpose AI models that can perform a range of natural language processing-based tasks.\nInvestors have remained hesitant to fund foundational projects, citing high costs and uncertainty. With growing interest from the government and large companies, key stakeholders have now started showing interest, explains Vardhan, who is developing a generative AI model with 9 trillion data points, which he says will operate at a significantly lower cost.\n“By hosting our model on Indian servers, we've reduced costs to nearly one-third of DeepSeek's token costs. This will make our model extremely affordable, enabling widespread adoption and potentially disrupting the market,” he adds. He plans to release the model by April.\nA big challenge in India is its diversity of languages, with 22 scheduled languages and hundreds of dialects and so on; it is a problem that doesn’t exist in the English-speaking world or in China. Most existing AI models struggle with India-specific use cases due to a lack of training data.\n“Our next generation is mixing English with Hindi characters, so AI needs to be multilingual, understand dialects, and understand nuances,” says Pranav Mistry, founder of TWO AI, a multilingual and cost-efficient language model startup building from Silicon Valley for the Asian market.\nTWO AI recently introduced Sutra-R0, a reasoning model for structured thinking and complex decision-making in various languages and domains. The model addresses enterprise and consumer needs with its efficient resource usage and multilingual capabilities. Backed by a $20-million seed fund from Jio Platforms (a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, publishers of Forbes India) and South Korean internet conglomerate Naver, TWO AI’s ChatSutra has 1.5 million users in multiple languages, including Gujarati, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Indonesian.\n“In our first revenue-generating quarter, we made $7 million [last quarter]. This quarter, we've already reached a $10 million run rate,” adds Mistry, who launched TWO AI three and a half years ago. The company is working with major banks in South Korea and India, finance institutions, mortgage groups, and retail applications.\nSutra’s makers say it was “trained from scratch” and developed over a period of 18 months. They fed it a mix of open and proprietary datasets, allowing it to learn structure, grammar, facts, and reasoning on its own. This has made it more cost-efficient to train and run, particularly in non-English languages, where it outperforms some existing models, they say.\nIndia also needs better localised datasets. Government-backed Bhashini, a language translation technology project, and IT services company Tech Mahindra’s Project Indus have also built models tailored to the country's linguistic diversity. Bhashini has created an open-source Indic language dataset to expand internet accessibility in Indian languages like Hindi, Tamil, and Bengali.\n“We've developed our models from square one, leveraging encoder-decoder technologies and other fundamental AI technologies. To achieve this, we collaborated with approximately 70 research institutes across India,” says Amitabh Nag, CEO of Bhashini, which enables real-time speech translation in 22 languages.\nCurrently, it’s processing about 3.6 million inferences daily, with 166 million inferences in January alone. “If OpenAI wants to support English and a few other languages, we step in as the translation engine. We translate customer input from their local language to English, which is then processed by OpenAI's prompt engineering. The response is then translated back to the customer's local language,” explains Nag.\nAlso Read: Five questions to Manav Garg on Together's AI bets in India\nTech Mahindra’s Project Indus, launched last year in collaboration with Dell Technologies and Intel, created an AI model that understands and communicates in multiple Indic languages and dialects, starting with Hindi and its 37 variations. The differentiator of this project is its efficiency, says Nikhil Malhotra, chief innovation officer & global head of AI and Emerging Technologies at Tech Mahindra. “It’s built with an investment of less than $400,000. It demonstrates how high-quality AI solutions can be developed without high costs, making it an attractive model for enterprise adoption.”\nShortly after the launch of DeepSeek, Government of India’s IndiaAI Mission invited proposals from startups, researchers, and entrepreneurs to build foundation models for the country. The models can be LLMs or small language models (SLMs) across multimodal text, voice, or video. IndiaAI will fund these through grants, compute credits, or equity investment.\nSo far, the government has received over 60 proposals, which include players like Sarvam AI, CoRover.ai, and Ola’s Krutrim. The plan is to develop the country's own AI model within the next nine to 10 months, as promised by Minister of Electronics & IT Ashwini Vaishnaw.\n“We've received 69 proposals—a testament to the ecosystem's capabilities and confidence,” says Abhishek Singh, additional secretary, MeitY, and CEO of IndiaAI Mission. “The government will provide funding, but ultimately, venture capital [VC] firms and other investors must also contribute. Together, they'll need to collaborate to build something state-of-the-art, comparable to the world's best.”\nRahul Agarwalla, managing partner at SenseAI, an early-stage VC investing in AI-first startups, echoes Nandan Nilekani, former chairman of India’s Unique ID Authority, who has emphasised the need for population-scale AI applications. “Practically, we should focus on building applications that deliver value to people,” he says. “When I speak with founders, I emphasise the importance of solving real problems. While we support efforts to build LLMs, it's not a prerequisite for success.”\nLast year, $100 billion was invested in AI ventures worldwide, adds Agarwalla; almost 50 percent of US VC fund went to AI companies. In contrast, India received just $1 billion, accounting for only 1 percent of global AI investments.\nIndian homegrown AI models will have to compete with established players such as OpenAI and Google and other deeply funded ventures such as Anthropic.\n“The question remains: Is there a market for Indian homegrown models?” says Neil Shah, co-founder and vice president of research at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. “While it's possible to use global foundational models and train them with Indian data for local applications, creating a homegrown foundational model is a significant challenge.”\nSarvam AI, in Bengaluru, is exploring building on top of open-source models. Its Sarvam 1 model was built entirely from scratch, explains co-founder Vivek Raghavan, “but other models may be a combination of our development and open-source components. The approach varies depending on the application and requirements.”\nThe venture is preparing to submit a proposal to the Ministry of Electronics and IT to develop India's first indigenous foundational AI model. With the ministry announcing that at least six teams will undertake this ambitious project, Sarvam AI is positioning itself as a key contender. Sarvam AI plans to launch its foundational models by year-end, offering advanced capabilities in reasoning, research, and query-answering without relying on external supplements.\nIn making AI a reality in India, Raghavan sees three main challenges beyond investments: Building large models requires skilled professionals, access to relevant data is crucial, and managing computational resources efficiently. “These three ingredients—talent, data, and compute—are essential for success. With the right combination of these elements, I believe we can make significant progress in AI adoption in India,” he says.",

         "By Eduardo Baptista, Julie Zhu and Fanny Potkin\nBEIJING/HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) – DeepSeek is looking to press home its advantage.\nThe Chinese startup triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month with a cut-price AI reasoning model that outperformed many Western competitors.\nNow, the Hangzhou-based firm is accelerating the launch of the successor to January’s R1 model, according to three people familiar with the company.\nDeepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics.\nThe company says it hopes the new model will produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. Details of the accelerated timeline for R2’s release have not been previously reported.\nDeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nRivals are still digesting the implications of R1, which was built with less-powerful Nvidia chips but is competitive with those developed at the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars by U.S. tech giants.\n“The launch of DeepSeek’s R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry,” said Vijayasimha Alilughatta, chief operating officer of Indian tech services provider Zensar. DeepSeek’s success at creating cost-effective AI models “would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts … breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field,” he said.\nR2 is likely to worry the U.S. government, which has identified leadership of AI as a national priority. Its release may further galvanize Chinese authorities and companies, dozens of which say they have started integrating DeepSeek models into their products.\nLittle is known about DeepSeek, whose founder Liang Wenfeng became a billionaire through his quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang, who was described by a former employer as “low-key and introverted,” has not spoken to any media since July 2024.\nReuters interviewed a dozen former employees, as well as quant fund professionals knowledgeable about the operations of DeepSeek and its parent company High-Flyer. It also reviewed state media articles, social-media posts from the companies and research papers dating back to 2019.\nThey told a story of a company that functioned more like a research lab than a for-profit enterprise and was unencumbered by the hierarchical traditions of China’s high-pressure tech industry, even as it became responsible for what many investors see as the latest breakthrough in AI.\nDIFFERENT PATH\nLiang was born in 1985 in a rural village in the southern province of Guangdong. He later obtained communication engineering degrees at the elite Zhejiang University.\nOne of his first jobs was running a research department at a smart imaging firm in Shanghai. His then-boss, Zhou Chaoen, told state media on Feb. 9 that Liang had hired prize-winning algorithm engineers and operated with a “flat management style.”\nAt DeepSeek and High-Flyer, Liang has similarly shunned the practices of Chinese tech giants known for rigid top-down management, low pay for young employees and “996” – working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.\nLiang opened his Beijing office within walking distance of Tsinghua University and Peking University, China’s two most prestigious education institutions. He regularly delved into technical details and was happy to work alongside Gen-Z interns and recent graduates that comprised the bulk of its workforce, according to two former employees. They also described usually working eight-hour days in a collaborative atmosphere.\n“Liang gave us control and treated us as experts. He constantly asked questions and learned alongside us,” said 26-year-old researcher Benjamin Liu, who left the company in September. “DeepSeek allowed me to take ownership of critical parts of the pipeline, which was very exciting.”\nLiang did not respond to questions sent via DeepSeek.\nWhile Baidu and other Chinese tech giants were racing to build their consumer-facing versions of ChatGPT in 2023 and profit off of the global AI boom, Liang told Chinese media outlet Waves last year that he deliberately avoided spending heavily on app development, focusing instead on refining the AI model’s quality.\nBoth DeepSeek and High-Flyer are known for paying generously, according to three people familiar with its compensation practices. At High-Flyer, it is not uncommon for a senior data scientist to make 1.5 million yuan annually, while competitors rarely pay more than 800,000, said one of the people, a rival quant fund manager who knows Liang.\nThe largesse was funded by High-Flyer, which became one of China’s most successful quant funds and, even after a government crackdown on the sector, still manages tens of billions of yuan, according to two people in the industry.\nCOMPUTING POWER\nDeepSeek’s success with a low-cost AI model is based on High-Flyer’s decade-long and substantial investment in research and computing power, three people said.\nThe quant fund was an earlier pioneer in AI trading and a top executive said in 2020 that High-Flyer was going “all in” on AI by re-investing 70% of its revenue, mostly into AI research.\nHigh-Flyer spent 1.2 billion yuan on two supercomputing AI clusters in 2020 and 2021. The second cluster, Fire-Flyer II, was made up of around 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, used for training AI models.\nDeepSeek had not been established at that time, so the accumulation of computing power caught the attention of Chinese securities regulators, said a person with direct knowledge of officials’ thinking.\n“Regulators wanted to know why they need so many chips?” the person said. “How they were going to use it? What kind of impact would that have on the market?”\nAuthorities decided not to intervene, in a move that would prove crucial for DeepSeek’s fortunes: the U.S. banned the export of A100 chips to China in 2022, at which point Fire-Flyer II was already in operation.\nBeijing now celebrates DeepSeek, but has instructed it not to engage with the media without approval, according to a person familiar with Chinese official thinking.\nAuthorities had asked Liang to keep a low-profile because they were worried that too much hype in the media would draw unnecessary attention, the person said.\nChina’s cabinet and commerce ministry, as well as China’s securities regulator, did not respond to requests for comment.\nAs one of the few companies with a large A100 cluster, High-Flyer and DeepSeek were able to attract some of China’s best research talent, two former employees said.\n“The key advantage of vast (computing) resources is that it allows for large-scale experimentation,” said Liu, the former employee.\nSome Western AI entrepreneurs, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, have claimed that DeepSeek had as many as 50,000 higher-end Nvidia chips that are banned for export to China. He has not produced evidence for the allegation or responded to Reuters’ requests to provide proof.\nDeepSeek has not responded to Wang’s claims. Two former employees attributed the company’s success to Liang’s focus on more cost-effective AI architecture.\nThe startup used techniques like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and multihead latent attention (MLA), which incur far lower computing costs, its research papers show.\nThe MoE technique divides an AI model into different areas of expertise and activates only those related to a query, as opposed to more common architectures that use the entire model.\nMLA architecture allows a model to process different aspects of one piece of information simultaneously, helping it detect key details more effectively.\nWhile competitors like France’s Mistral have developed models based on MoE, DeepSeek was the first firm to depend heavily on this architecture while achieving parity with more expensively built models.\nDeepSeek’s pricing was 20 to 40 times cheaper than what OpenAI charged for equivalent models, analysts at Bernstein brokerage estimated in early February.\nFor now, Western and Chinese tech giants have signaled plans to continue heavy AI spending, but DeepSeek’s success with R1 and its earlier V3 model has prompted some to alter strategies.\nOpenAI cut prices this month, while Google’s Gemini has introduced discounted tiers of access. Since R1’s launch, OpenAI has also released an O3-Mini model that relies on less computing power.\nAdnan Masood of U.S. tech services provider UST told Reuters that his laboratory had run benchmarks that found R1 often used three times as many tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, for reasoning as OpenAI’s scaled-down model.\nSTATE EMBRACE\nEven before R1 gripped global attention, there were signs that DeepSeek had caught Beijing’s favor. In January, state media reported that Liang attended a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing as the designated representative of the AI sector, ahead of the leaders of better-known firms.\nThe subsequent fanfare over the cost competitiveness of its models has buoyed Beijing’s belief that it can out-innovate the U.S., with Chinese companies and government bodies embracing DeepSeek models at a pace that has not been offered to other firms.\nAt least 13 Chinese city governments and 10 state-owned energy companies say they have deployed DeepSeek into their systems, while tech giants Lenovo, Baidu and Tencent – owner of China’s largest social media app WeChat – have integrated DeepSeek’s models into their products.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and Li “have signalled they endorse DeepSeek,” said Alfred Wu, an expert on Chinese policymaking at Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. “Now everyone just endorses it.”\nThe Chinese embrace comes as governments from South Korea to Italy remove DeepSeek from national app stores, citing privacy concerns.\n“If DeepSeek becomes the go-to AI model across Chinese state entities, Western regulators might see this as another reason to escalate restrictions on AI chips or software collaborations,” said Stephen Wu, an AI expert and founder of hedge fund Carthage Capital.\nFurther limits on advanced AI chips are a challenge that Liang has acknowledged.\n“Our problem has never been funding,” he told Waves in July. “It’s the embargo on high-end chips.”\n(Additional reporting by Samuel Shen, Gu Li, Larissa Liao, Aditya Soni and Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Brenda Goh and Katerina Ang)",

         "The AI ecosystem has experienced a major shift, which may define the future of AI economy and investment. A Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, has introduced an AI model that is on par with the best in the market, such as ChatGPT by OpenAI, but it was created in a shorter time and at a lower cost. This is a significant shift in the financial and technological aspect and the effects are likely to be felt not only in the AI industry, investment markets, and even in the regulatory aspects. The development also raises important questions about whether large-scale investments in AI infrastructure are actually necessary or if more prudent designs like DeepSeek will become the norm. This shift may have a significant impact on, for instance, financial report analysis and algorithmic decision making processes and, therefore, on other sectors such as forex trading app development that rely on predictive analytics.\nOne of the most striking aspects of DeepSeek’s achievement is its budget. Some of the big AI players like Google, OpenAI, and Meta have spent billions of dollars developing their models whereas DeepSeek was able to create an AI system with the same level of performance for $5.6 million. This cost efficiency threatens the idea that cutting edge AI requires huge capital to develop, and thus allows new players and small companies to contend in the market. Hence, the investors who have invested their money in companies with high capacity to innovate in the area of AI may have to change their investment plans. The possibility of creating high-quality AI at lower costs means that AI investment will not be centralized in a few large corporations, which will lead to a more fragmented market with many competitors.\nNvidia, the company that builds the GPUs that are used largely in today’s AI development, has lost about $600 billion in market value according to reports due to concerns that cheaper forms of AI such as DeepSeek could reduce the need for its expensive processors. Although Nvidia and other similar firms will remain important actors in the AI infrastructure, investors are now wondering if the current AI spending model of Western tech companies is still reasonable.\nThe effects of DeepSeek’s growth are not only felt in the stock market but also in the geopolitical and regulatory level. AI is not only about the creation of new solutions it is also about the control. The success of DeepSeek has raised concerns that China is potentially gaining an important lead in AI with potential implications for national security to the West. When governments have usually left the development of AI to corporations, they may now have to act more forcefully either by offering subsidies to maintain competition or by imposing stricter rules to prevent the control of AI from shifting to other countries. However, it remains to be seen how the rising power of Chinese AI firms will affect international AI governance as policymakers seek to mitigate risks associated with state surveillance and propaganda.\nThis is not a completely unfounded fear as there is evidence that the AI model of DeepSeek is censoring content in real-time on politically sensitive subjects. DeepSeek has the censorship features integrated within the platform where it is impossible to discuss matters like Tiananmen Square or Taiwan. This high extent of preventative control reveals the cultural and philosophical distinctions between the AI created in democratic and authoritarian states. Investors and tech analysts will have to consider not only the technological features of the AI models but also the risks of applying AI systems that can be controlled by the government.\nHowever, the birth of a high-quality and low-cost AI model is undoubtedly good for the industries that depend on AI solutions. Companies in the healthcare, education, and financial sectors, among others, that have in the past struggled to incorporate complex AI integrations into their operations may now be able to gain access to powerful AI tools at lower costs. There is a possibility of democratizing AI, which can lead to new innovations in various industries and result in better patient care, smarter automation, and improved customer interactions. This means that companies that were once locked out of the market due to high entry fees will now be able to embrace AI and expand the technology’s coverage.\nThese developments are being met with changing investment strategies. VC firms who have previously focused on funding AI companies that require large compute capacity may start looking for companies that focus on computational efficiency and innovative architectures. This change may benefit AI startups outside of Silicon Valley and especially those in countries with limited resources. The reduced costs of developing AI may also lead more companies to focus on the applications of AI rather than the core AI research and may result in a new wave of AI-based startups focused on niche areas like legal services, supply chain management, and content creation.\nHowever, classic AI giants will probably have to modify their approaches. These companies, including Google and OpenAI, have gained their reputation from building big, resource-hungry AI models, and they may have to change their strategies and build lighter, more efficient models. This could result in a more balanced AI innovation environment in which both large corporations and small companies are equally important. It may also mean that AI producers will have to look for other ways to distinguish their models, such as through greater specialization, the use of proprietary data or unique deployment strategies.\nTherefore, the emergence of DeepSeek can be regarded as the beginning of a new AI generation. The notion that a few giant corporations can control the AI sector is being defeated, and this opens the door for new contenders and strategies. The investment community will have to act quickly and determine which companies are most likely to benefit from this shift. Although AI is one of the most important and growing sectors of technology, the rules of the game are changing. Therefore, those who grasp the importance of efficient AI development will be in the best position to benefit from this transformation.",

         "About a month ago, the world woke up to a shock. The release of the large language model DeepSeek R1, a chatbot with powerful reasoning capabilities, forced the tech world to reconsider its approach to artificial intelligence (AI) advancement altogether. DeepSeek — a subsidiary AI research company of a quantitative trading firm based in Hangzhou, China — caused losses in the stock market worth hundreds of billions for leading firms like OpenAI and Nvidia. Overnight, DeepSeek’s mobile app rose to the top spot in Apple’s App Store and stole the limelight in the AI field.\nDeepSeek’s meteoric surge is controversial, to say the least. Its R1 model can allegedly match the performance of leading models like OpenAI’s o1 at a fraction of the costs. The R1 is a smaller reasoning model trained from DeepSeek’s V3, a larger general-purpose model comparable to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The V3 reportedly cost less than $6 million to train (though the actual figure is heavily contested).\nU.S. embargoes on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) handicap AI firms based in China. GPUs were initially computer components designed for image processing on personal computers but have since then been used in cryptocurrency mining and AI development. Computing power is essential to model-training capabilities; more powerful and plentiful GPUs allow firms to train their models on more parameters, tuning them to produce more accurate and reliable answers. The fact that the R1 displayed comparable performances to leading models based in the United States, despite its purportedly low training costs and hardware limitations, was why the model sparked such strong reactions in the market and the media.\nThe AI arms race has become a crucial part of the United States’ foreign policy, especially with regard to China. The Stargate Project­ — a government-supported joint venture between OpenAI, Japan-based investment firm SoftBank and others that would invest more than $500 billion in AI infrastructure — makes clear the U.S. government’s great emphasis on AI competitiveness.\nAI has become an irreplaceable way for many of us to interact with information. From misleading news to videos, AI’s capability to spread misinformation and disinformation poses potential threats to truth and democracy. AI could be used as a means of cognitive warfare, challenging users’ beliefs and making them question their values.\nMany countries have already placed restrictions on DeepSeek’s models for this reason. Taiwan, whose sovereignty is the most immediately threatened by China, quickly banned using DeepSeek models on government devices. South Korea, Australia and some U.S. states have also restricted access to these models, citing similar concerns.\nAnything related to China and technology has become a target for politicization. TikTok was the last example, and now it’s DeepSeek. Most of these precautions are sufficiently backed by evidence and well-grounded in national security concerns. At the same time, the politicization of such technologies has cultivated a strong anti-China sentiment that stands in the way of academic research progress and international collaboration.\nIn response to DeepSeek’s models, OpenAI accused the company of breaching its intellectual property via a training method known as distillation. Distillation is when a large general model, known as the teacher model, is “distilled” into a smaller, usually more specialized model. It’s a common technique used in model training to slim down large models and allow them to be run with fewer hardware requirements. OpenAI has stated that there is evidence to prove that DeepSeek distilled its models, but it hasn’t publicly released anything concrete.\nHowever, the distillation controversy has been turned into an unproven, heavily politicized narrative. It feeds into other arguments, like suggesting that DeepSeek didn’t achieve anything remarkable or that it wouldn’t have existed without OpenAI. In reality, it has made breakthroughs in the mathematical and computational methods that optimize the AI training process, increasing its hardware and energy efficiency.\nInternational tension easily creates false narratives that belittle and antagonize. Regulatory measures against the use of technology in cognitive warfare are, of course, required to defend countries’ democracy and sovereignty. However, the excessive politicization of technology impedes our understanding and continuation of AI progress and innovation.\nIronically, OpenAI is not open at all, while DeepSeek is open-source. It’s also interesting to consider the numerous lawsuits OpenAI is facing for breaches of intellectual property, only for it to accuse another company of the same.\nThe point is that it is incredibly short-sighted and one-dimensional to use politicization to blindly diminish the achievements of other countries and blindly praise the ones of your own. Acknowledging and learning from what others have developed is the first step toward adapting and improving your own offerings.",

The bank's outgoing chief executive Piyush Gupta also said it expected to create around 1,000 new AI-related jobs.\nIt makes DBS one of the first major banks to offer details on how AI will affect its operations.\nThe company did not say how many jobs would be cut in Singapore.\n\"Over the next three years, we envisage that AI could reduce the need to renew about 4,000 temporary/contract staff across our 19 markets working on specific projects,\" the DBS spokesperson said.\n\"As such, we expect the reduction in workforce will come from natural attrition as these temporary and contract roles are completed over the next few years.\"\nDBS currently has between 8,000 and 9,000 temporary and contract workers. The bank employs a total of around 41,000 people.\nLast year, Mr Gupta said DBS had been working on AI for over a decade.\n\"We today deploy over 800 AI models across 350 use cases, and expect the measured economic impact of these to exceed S$1bn ($745m; £592m) in 2025,\" he added.\nMr Gupta is set to leave the firm at the end of March. Current deputy chief executive Tan Su Shan will replace him.\nThe ongoing proliferation of AI technology has put its benefits and risks under the spotlight, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) saying in 2024 that it is set to affect nearly 40% of all jobs worldwide.\nThe IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva said that \"in most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality\".\nThe governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, told the BBC last year that AI will not be a \"mass destroyer of jobs\" and human workers will learn to work with new technologies.\nMr Bailey said that while there are risks with AI, \"there is great potential with it\".",

         "“About 4,000 employees may lose their jobs in the next three to four years owing to Artificial Intelligence (AI),” said Piyush Gupta, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of DBS Bank, at the NASSCOM Technology and Leadership Summit 2025. This would be a tenth of the company’s work force he said.\n“My current prediction, in the next three years, we’d shrink our workforce by 4,000, 10%. And that is because, AI is different” Mr. Gupta said at the event in Mumbai. He further said this was a much newer trend as he has never had to fire employees owing to technological transition so far.\n“The fact that technology will be good for customers and employees is a utopian view. This was because unlike other technologies, AI is self-creating,” he said. While he acknowledged the positive view that people will continue to find jobs, he said there would be “massive dislocations.”\n“When the car came and the stagecoach went, you would argue that at the end of the day, the economy is prospered, transportation and industry grew. But I can tell you, all the stagecoach drivers didn’t necessarily come so fast unless they learnt how to drive. So, if you go back to India, it’s been a large people (who) got displaced. And when people got displaced, the new jobs were not the same. So, you look at the jobs we are creating. We are getting a lot of jobs, the cyber security specialists, the AI people. But a lot of my traditional operations people, the clerical staff, all the time, it’s not easy for them for the transition,” Mr. Gupta said highlighting the effects of the AI on jobs.\nAI may not steal many jobs after all, it may just make workers more efficient\nMr. Gupta flagged that the number of jobs that are being created is smaller than the number being displaced. While on the one hand he appreciated the positive view of AI, he said the “dystopian view” was driven by the fact that he was struggling to create jobs for the first time in 15 years of being CEO.\nMeanwhile in a separate statement, the company said that the reduction of 4,000 employees over the next three years will primarily involve contract and temporary staff. The workforce reduction will also come from natural attrition, as temporary and contract roles roll off over the coming years.",

         "SINGAPORE – DBS Group Holdings expects to reduce its contract and temporary staff by around 4,000 over the next three years as artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly takes on roles carried out by humans, outgoing chief executive officer Piyush Gupta said.\n“The reduction in workforce will come from natural attrition as temporary and contract roles roll off over the next few years,” a DBS spokesperson said in response to queries from The Straits Times, without giving details such as how many Singapore workers are affected and what roles they are in.\nMr Gupta was confirming a Press Trust of India news agency report which said that the bank will trim its workforce following further adoption of AI across its business.\nDBS has 8,000 to 9,000 of such workers, according to Mr Gupta, who said permanent staff will not be affected.\nDBS, based in Singapore, has a total headcount of around 41,000 staff. Ms Tan Su Shan, currently DBS deputy CEO, will succeed Mr Gupta on March 28.\nGlobal banks will cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as AI encroaches on tasks currently carried out by humans, said a Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) report in January. Chief information and technology officers surveyed for BI indicated that on average they expect a net 3 per cent of their workforce to be cut, according to the report.\nStill, many firms have stressed that the shift will result in roles being changed by technology, rather than replaced altogether.\nMs Teresa Heitsenrether, who oversees JPMorgan Chase’s AI efforts, said in November 2024 that the bank’s adoption of generative AI was so far augmenting jobs.

In a statement shared with FinancialExpress.com, the company said that the CEO was referring to temporary and contractual staff.\nIn a statement, DBS Bank said, “The reduction of 4,000 employees over the next three years will primarily involve contract and temporary staff. The workforce reduction will also come from natural attrition, as temporary and contract roles roll off over the coming years.”\nEarlier while speaking at a Nasscom event, Piyush Gupta had said that DBS Group anticipates a 10 per cent reduction in its workforce over the next three years due to deeper integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into its operations. He highlighted how AI is unlike any other technology previously adopted, making workforce restructuring inevitable.\n“This year, my current projection is that in the next three years, we are going to shrink our workforce by 4,000 or 10 per cent,” Gupta had said, while adding “In my 15 years of being a CEO, for the first time, I’m struggling to create jobs. So far, I’ve always had a line of sight to what jobs I can create. This time I’m struggling to say how will I repurpose people to create jobs.”",

         "Singapore’s DBS Group sees its workforce shrinking by 4,000 or 10 per cent over the next three years, due to deployment of artificial intelligence, group CEO Piyush Gupta said at an industry event.\nIn a fireside chat at an event organised by Nasscom, Gupta said that in 2016-17 the bank had identified 1,600 jobs that were redundant due to increasing automation. The management worked with the unions and the staff to create a transition pathway and to find alternative roles for them within the organisation. While some of them retired and many others quit, around 1200 of them were absorbed in other roles. “So I’ve never had to fire anybody,” said Gupta.\nHowever, he projected a reduction in the workforce over the next three years because, “AI is different.” He pointed out that AI is not a tool that “you use”. “AI can actually self-create and can manipulate.” The bank has added 1,000 people in AI, he said.\nDBS bank has over 6,500 employees in India..\nin a clarification the bank said, “The reduction of 4,000 employees over the next three years will primarily involve contract and temporary staff. The workforce reduction will also come from natural attrition, as temporary and contract roles roll off over the coming years.”\nAlso read: Maharashtra sets sights on becoming India’s AI hub\nThe bank is using AI for internal job mobility, as well as to manage frauds, scams and risk. It is also using AI models for portfolio management as well as to onboard customers. “Our customer engagement rates are up… the volume of business that customers do is also up. Our ability to underwrite customers and bring them on board changes dramatically,” Gupta said, adding that it has 20 million clients now compared to 6 million a few years back.\nDBS Group, which last year marked three decades of its presence in India, reported income of S$22.3 billion in 2024 and net profit of S$11.4 billion.",

         "DBS Group Holdings plans to cut about 4,000 of its contract and temporary staff workforce over the next three years as artificial intelligence increasingly takes on roles carried out by human beings.",
         "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/c4082a28c2f2e599bb937256b64470fdc1abb9b7d81baa7ac524158e187d9685",
         "DBS Group Holdings plans to cut about 4,000 of its contract and temporary staff workforce over the next three years as artificial intelligence increasingly takes on roles carried out by human beings.\nSouth-east Asia’s largest lender has approximately 8,000 to 9,000 of such staff, according to chief executive officer Piyush Gupta replying to a query from Bloomberg News. He confirmed a Press Trust of India news agency report which said the bank will trim its workforce following further adoption of AI across its business.\nPermanent staff will not be affected, the outgoing CEO said. DBS has around 41,000 staff and Tan Su Shan, currently deputy CEO, will succeed Gupta on Mar 28.\nA DBS spokesperson said: “The reduction in workforce will come from natural attrition as temp and contract roles roll off over the next few years.”\nMy current projection in the next three years, we’ll shrink our workforce by about 4,000 or 10%,” Gupta said at an industry conference in Mumbai. The outgoing CEO, however, said 1,000 new positions will be added in AI.\nGupta is among the first major banking chiefs to lay out details of possible job losses due to AI.\n“In my 15 years of being a CEO, for the first time, I’m struggling to create jobs. So far, I’ve always had a line of sight to what jobs I can create. This time I’m struggling to say how will I repurpose people to create jobs,” Gupta added.\nGlobal banks will cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as artificial intelligence encroaches on tasks currently carried out by human workers, said a Bloomberg Intelligence report last month.\nChief information and technology officers surveyed for BI indicated that on average they expect a net 3 per cent of their workforce to be cut, according to the report.\nStill, many firms have stressed that the shift will result in roles being changed by technology, rather than replaced altogether. Teresa Heitsenrether, who oversees JPMorgan Chase’s AI efforts, said in November that the bank’s adoption of generative AI was so far augmenting jobs.\nIn its latest results announcement, DBS said net profit for the fourth quarter rose 11 per cent from a year ago. Net profit for the three months ended Dec 31, 2024, was S$2.52 billion, compared with S$2.27 billion previously, and was slightly short of expectations.\nExcluding one-off items – a S$100 million corporate social responsibility commitment to DBS Foundation and other charitable causes – Q4 net profit would have been up 10 per cent at S$2.62 billion.\nFollowing the results, analysts raised target prices and dividend estimates on DBS, predicting higher valuation ahead.\nMaybank said DBS was giving significant visibility on capital returns. While earnings could grow at just 1 per cent compound annual growth rate between FY2025 and FY2027, dividends could expand at 7 per cent, delivering yields higher than 6.5 per cent, it said.\nIt upgraded its estimate for dividend per share (DPS) by 14 to 22 per cent between FY2025 and FY2027.\nRHB added that one key highlight was DBS’ management providing clarity on the quantum of excess capital of S$8 billion, and reaffirming its commitment to return this to shareholders over the next three years.\nThat will start with a capital return dividend of S$0.15 per share per quarter for FY2025 that DBS announced on Monday.\nThat is over and above its earlier share buyback programme and a S$0.24 increase in ordinary DPS this year, RHB noted. After factoring in the capital return dividend, RHB’s estimate for its FY2025 DPS is S$3.06, from S$2.46. BLOOMBERG, REUTERS",

         "[Editor’s note: The article has been updated to reflect DBS’s statement.]\nDBS Group Holding’s outgoing CEO, Piyush Gupta, announced that the company plans to lay off 4,000 contract and temporary staff roles over the next three years as artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly takes on roles carried out by human beings.\nGupta made this announcement at an industry conference in Mumbai, India, yesterday (February 24), where he added that permanent staff will not be affected. However, he also shared that 1,000 new positions will be added in AI, CNA reports.\nIn my 15 years of being a CEO, for the first time, I’m struggling to create jobs. So far, I’ve always had a line of sight to what jobs I can create. This time, I’m struggling to say how I will repurpose people to create jobs.\nPiyush Gupta, outgoing CEO of DBS Group Holdings at a industry conference in Mumbai, India\nCurrently, the company has 8,000 to 9,000 employees in such positions and has a total headcount of around 41,000 staff.\nResponding to media enquiries from Vulcan Post, a spokesperson from DBS shared that the reduction in headcount will come from “natural attrition” as temporary and contract roles are completed in the next few years.\nOver the next 3 years, we envisage that AI could reduce the need to renew about 4,000 temporary/ contract staff across our 19 markets working on specific projects. As such, we expect the reduction in workforce will come from natural attrition as these temporary and contract roles are completed over the next few years.\nOur permanent staff across all our markets are not impacted.\nA DBS spokesperson responding to media enquiries from Vulcan Post\nAI replacing human roles at banks\nAccording to a Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) article in January, global banks will cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as AI encroaches on tasks currently carried out by human workers.\nChief information and technology officers surveyed for BI indicated that, on average, they expect a net 3% of their workforce to be cut. The report also shared that back and middle office roles and operations are most likely to be affected.\n“Any jobs involving routine, repetitive tasks are at risk. But AI will not eliminate them fully, rather it will lead to workforce transformation,” stated Tomasz Noetzel, a senior analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence, who also penned the report.\nHowever, this might lean more towards a “utopian view” for some, like Gupta. While he appreciated the perspective that people will continue to find jobs, he warned that there might be “massive dislocations,” The Hindu reports.\n“We are getting a lot of jobs, the cyber security specialists, the AI people. But a lot of my traditional operations people, the clerical staff, all the time, it’s not easy for them to transition [to new jobs created],” said the banking veteran, highlighting the effects of AI on jobs.\nBut not all hope is lost\nWith that said, there are ways for those in similar positions to “change” your predicament. We previously reported the five skills that Singaporeans can build to do what machines can’t. Here’s a list:\nData analysis and critical thinking skills\nBuilding functional and job-specific expertise\nProject Management\nCreativity\nAdvanced digital skills (eg. programming, AI literacy, etc)\nHowever, we also found that 19% of Singaporeans dedicate no time to reskill, which is above the regional average of 13%. This is where employers can play a pivotal role in helping employees build up their arsenal beyond degrees and paper qualifications.\nWhen asked how they intend to reassure their permanent staff in terms of job security, a DBS spokesperson expressed the company’s commitment to continue investing in upskilling and reskilling its employees to be “future-ready.”\n“We have identified around 13,000 staff for upskilling or reskilling and to date, over 10,000 have commenced their respective learning roadmaps, including on skills such as AI and data.”\nRead more articles on Artificial Intelligence here.\nRead more articles we have written on Singaporean businesses here.\nFeatured Image Credit: DBS Bank",

This step is driven by the increasing acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, which will take responsibilities that are currently handled by human employees.\nThe positions affected will mainly consist of temporary and contract staff, with the reduction of the workforce as a result of natural progress as projects are completed.

Current deputy chief executive Tan Su Shan will replace him.\nThe ongoing proliferation of AI technology has put its benefits and risks under the spotlight, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) saying in 2024 that it is set to affect nearly 40% of all jobs worldwide.\nThe IMF’s managing director Kristalina Georgieva said that “in most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality”.\nThe governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, told the BBC last year that AI will not be a “mass destroyer of jobs” and human workers will learn to work with new technologies.\nMr Bailey said that while there are risks with AI, “there is great potential with it”.",

         "Singapore-based DBS Group is cutting its headcount by 10% as artificial intelligence (AI) takes on more human work.\nThe bank, which has 41,000 employees globally, expects to slash around 4,000 roles in a move that will impact contract and temporary workers, with permanent staff unaffected.\nAccording to DBS, the redundancies will be the result of “natural attrition” on completion of projects over the next few years.\nAs Southeast Asia’s largest lender, the bank currently employs between 8,000 and 9,000 contract and temporary staff, but it did not specify how many jobs would go in Singapore.\nAt the same time, outgoing CEO Piyush Gupta, who is leaving the firm at the end of March, said he anticipates that around 1,000 new AI-related positions will be created.\nIn 2024, he revealed that DBS had been developing AI technologies for more than 10 years.\nHe said: “We today deploy over 800 AI models across 350 use cases and expect the measured economic impact of these to exceed S$1bn (£592m).”\nThe company is one of the first big banks to outline how AI is expected to impact its operations, while many employers remain uncertain about its impact.\nEarlier this month in the UK, the CIPD said AI can help deliver growth but understanding its impact on jobs, skills needs and organisational strategy must be considered, as it started work in collaboration with the Innovate UK BridgeAI programme.\nAdditionally, back in January, Nuffield-funded research, the Pissarides Review into the Future of Work and Wellbeing, found that new technology, including automation and artificial intelligence (AI), can lead to better jobs – but only with the right HR strategy.\nThe final report of a three-year study into AI, work and wellbeing found that that when people are prioritised, the wellbeing impacts of new technology can be mitigated and work can be improved.\nHR opportunities in Accountancy, Banking, Finance and Insurance on Personnel Today",

It can self-create and mimic.” He also noted that in the past decade, the group has not seen any job cuts.\nIn a separate statement, a DBS spokesman told RBI: ” The reduction in workforce will come from natural attrition as temp and contract roles roll off over the next few years.”\nThe banking giant has a history of digital innovation, having previously undergone a major transformation between 2016 and 2017 that impacted 1,600 jobs.\nDuring that period, employees were reskilled and moved to new roles with union support. However, AI integration now presents a more complex challenge for workforce restructuring.\nDBS has been using generative AI solutions for the past two years, applying them to functions like customer outreach, credit underwriting, and hiring.\nDespite the benefits, the bank remains cautious about AI-generated errors, known as hallucinations, which could hinder the full automation of customer interactions.\nLast month, DBS Group increased its stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank Corporation (SRCB) to 19.40% from 16.69%.\nThe move supports the group’s strategy to concentrate on its core markets while expanding its presence in the Greater Bay Area.\nDBS acquired a 13% stake in SRCB in October 2021, increasing it to 16.69% in January 2024.",
